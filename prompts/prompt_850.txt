Review: originally titled ' do n't lose your head ' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions .two english fops , the ' powdered , be - wigged , be - ribboned ' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine .due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful .ffing becomes known as ' the black fingernail ' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail .after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen ' the big cheese ' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him .( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! )once at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly .he tells her his identity and gives her his locket .when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail !jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail .they pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchessede la plumede ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing .desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the ' chateau neuve ' , and a climactic sword - fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film !a more complex story than most carry ons, this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on - form cast .sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert 's thick - witted crony .other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit .although it suffers from a disasterously over - long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better - than - usual script .definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch .
