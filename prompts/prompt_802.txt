Review: i 'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing " disturbing behavior " with " scream ."maybe it 's because they 're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars ,both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess

Review: susan granger 's review of " legally blonde " ( m. g. m. )it 's a " pretty in pink " / " clueless " coming - of - age story for the new millenniumas elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend( matthew davis ) .the girl - power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : " if i 'm going to be a senator by the time i 'm 30 ...i need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn ." determined to prove she 's as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country - club connecticut ,elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty .once there , this flaxen - haired fish - out - of - water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) .in the tradition of teen - comedy film - maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there 's wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem - solving .first - time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who 's joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon - to - be - published novel by amanda brown .the supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink ,her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " legally blonde " is a frivolous , funny , feel - good 8 . filled with ditzy blonde ambition , it 's a movie for high - school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see .
