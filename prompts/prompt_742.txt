Review: niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse 's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young - lovers - on - the - road movies .wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas )meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store .a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms .what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette 's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics .tunney , displaying an acting rangenot hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year 's venice film festival .to term her worka tour - de - force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney 's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy 's illness -- which often causes her to act violently -- that much more convincing and tragic .she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off - kilter chemistry .their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss .a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger - happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable .but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney 's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .( opens march 20 )"i did n't know what to expect .it 's like something you chase for so long , but then you do n't know how to react when you get it .i still do n't know how to react ."--michaeljordan ,on winning his first nba championship in 1991 ...or , my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997
