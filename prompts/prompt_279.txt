Review: yet another brainless teen flick ,this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex .stars katie holmes and sarahpolly could n't look more bored .their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager out there .one thing you need to knowis i really hated this movie .everything about it annoyed the hell out of me .the acting , and script , the plot , and ending .the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film .the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality .i felt like i was watching dawson 's creek episode 200 .although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast .the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable .since when is a male character 's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ?go is dawson 's creek + varsity blues - she 's all that= go home and watch something else .
