Review: it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . it abounds with high production values : john toll 's award - winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick 's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . but this does not save a misguided script . the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer 's only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer - director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . but wallace 's actions

Review: well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he does n't look it !daylight is a great disaster movie .  if you 've seen cliffhanger , you 'll know stallone 's character already . a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! )stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom !>from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work o

Review: everything in the phantom you have seen many times before andthere is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .billy zane is wooden as the hero .kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of .oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity butthis is so poorly played out you wo n't even care .about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery .however , if you re looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper .this is not a good movie .
