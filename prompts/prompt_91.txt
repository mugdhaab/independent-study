Review: frank detorri 's ( bill murray )a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin ) .when he uses the ' 10 second rule ' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp 's cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system .inside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote - pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it 's up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly 's " osmosis jones ." the city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance .he 's inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv 's " frasier " ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense .this quarrelling duo are about to go on a " fantastic voyage " in order to hunt down thrax( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank .while the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones ' story is a hackneyed one .the story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule, he departs on a bus headed for bladder ) .neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated " predator " ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick .adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape .meanwhile , back in live action land , bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross - out joke .there 's no particular enjoyment to be found watchinghim vomit on molly shannon ( she plays shane 's teacher , mrs .boyd ) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table .one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child 's father will play to the family audience as well .rest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke .while far less offensive than the farrelly 's last effort " me , myself and irene , " that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey 's hijinx ."osmosis jones " will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune .
