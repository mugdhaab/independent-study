Review: ** * * * * minor plot spoilers in review** * * * * * * * * * *no major spoilers are in review** * * * * the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them . the ridley scott 's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . james cameron 's aliens was much more of an action film . and i liked each film separately for which it was . now alien 3 is out . and it is it 's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypers

Review: it 's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james ' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . she ca n't concentrate on her schoolwork , ca n't get a good night 's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . in the first movie , ` i know what you did last summer ' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr .  ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her co

Review: director doug ellin 's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story .like a sitcomwith jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it ,the movie meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame .the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless linesyou 've heard before .( " i 'm not wearing any underwear , " the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure - fire come - on line . )max , chicago 's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha .max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience .max is played without any style by david schwimmer .schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover .his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair .after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why should n't the personality - challenged be attracted ?the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test .jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act .max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does .the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work .neither the script nor the actors make this test believable ."the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you 're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ?" jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film .finally , there is the film 's attempt at physical comedy .jay 's ex - girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .natasha rips jay 's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa .as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it .this is supposed to be funny ?most films have some saving grace .some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture was n't . kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it .kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 .it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .
