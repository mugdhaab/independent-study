Review: come on hollywood , surprise me .  stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal , because his niece is one of the victims . it 's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there 's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who 've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to .  .  . well , you know the rest . a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype

Review: this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron 's most heralded film , titanic . postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?my best guess . .  .  .  it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that 's where the problem lies . there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire

Review: the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard 's materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute .indeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . including this year 's upcoming a midsummer night 's dream , shakespeare 's material has been the cause for twenty - six big screen productions since 1990 .but for a change of pace , mrs .brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love .marc norman and tom stoppard 's story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously .( will shakespeare of the 1590 's would 've been married to anne hathaway , and he would 've had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . )will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- " romeo and ethel , the pirate 's daughter " -- just does n't quite seem right .with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , " romeo and juliet ."the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect .fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy .the supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will 's worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman .even ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i .gwyneth paltrow is by far , however ,the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance .the story is well - crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the " let 's make a movie " -genre .the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience 's lowest common denominator .there 's something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material .although certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well - rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998 's pictures ; the true - love story is one of the best around .certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year's - open releases is just around the corner .
