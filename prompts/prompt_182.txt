Review: nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink - and - a - concussive - nudge bombast - o - rama con air . the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill - fated bar - room brawl . the prison scenes are accompanied by voice - overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim - witted and ridiculous , and that he 's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed - up version of raising arizona 's h . i . mcdonnough . cage should have known what he was gett

Review: the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be, in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . kilmeractually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . as a young boy , kilmer 's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy pr

Review: airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film - making .after all , it 's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing / directing teams .even if most people do n't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few .but although the zucker / abrahams / zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts .in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high .films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits .there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade .and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film .this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . .it had to do with bad fish .airplane !is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex - fighter - pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . unable to stop living in the past , ted 's world fell apart .he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) .in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working .unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self - pity .in the midst of it all , something happens .someone gets sick .then another .then another .soon , the whole plane is full of deathly - ill chicago - bound people ...and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul - jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ?( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non - stop " whiz - bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags .although i had seen this movie a few times before ,i was still laughing thru the entire thing .the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen .he 's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight - faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film .in a film like this , you 're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one ca n't complain about the amateurish quality .what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker .this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny .i do n't know why he was put in there , and i do n't think anybody will find a good excuse .and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old .you got ta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long .aside from that , airplane !is really a top - notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic .it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they have n't seen it .and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em" it 's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that 's not important right now ."if you 've seen the film , you 'll understand ; - )
