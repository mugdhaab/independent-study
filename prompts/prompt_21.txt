Review: one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . sometimes the stories are compelling . sometimes they 're not . but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i 've never been bored by any of the enterprise 's numerous missions . star trek : insurrection is no exception . the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it 's the worst in the series ) , but i 'm not really sure why . it 's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . some say it 's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . others say the special effects are cheesy and that it 's boring . i simply enjoyed the film . insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called

Review: " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie 's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head - scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . "he 's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but thisnutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji 's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there 's even

Review: it 's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of " award - winning " tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes .that said , hayes 's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic .but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary .those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film 's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno - deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over - protective , hyper religious , reagan - loving mother .gyllenhall 's sweet - natured delivery of jimmy 's hilariously na ?ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming - of - age story :jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld .his mom home - schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti - sexual messages , until he 's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door .jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss .but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks - addled cross - country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love .the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy 's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film 's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center onoutrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi .but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it 's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags .they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks .but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send - up of a cult called " bright ' nshiny , " led by the inimitable fabio . unfortunately ,a few giggles ca n't make bubble boy the riotous , off - the - wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . honestly ,it 's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i 'm not just saying that because it 's so mediocre . how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that does n't seem to appeal to any particular demographic andhas the potential to offend so many .and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real - life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney 's wondering the same thing .hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .
