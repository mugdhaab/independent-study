Review: just how inseparable is the team of sgt . martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ?let 's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it !the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs ' child and joe pesci as the soprana - like , foul - mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . new to the team is chris rock , also a fast - talking , up and coming detective . trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is

Review: before the remake of psycho appears , we 've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun ' in an loft apartment . the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . if i was paltrow , though , i 'd definitely go with mortensen . less wrinkles . anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he 'll pay him to kill his lovely wife . mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast .  in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s - l - o - w .  )the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . not too good fo

Review: the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany 's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook - yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable andshe is quite resistible .alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we 're fuck buddies . " )but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee 's inability to decide what she wants to be saying .she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .alessa is looking for financial securitybut she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .this appears to be a high profile and well - paid job .we are supposed to care about alessa 's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .alessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double - zero.i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
