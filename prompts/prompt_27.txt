Review: the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola 's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down - to - earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola 's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popula

Review: reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlingtonrd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . the guy ca n't seem to write believable dialogue( sample from reindeer games : " rule # 1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi - faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plotsbut he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard ," oh you thought my movie was gon na go here ,f* ck you jack ass , take that twist ,decipher this mother f * cker !"it 's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . and why the hell would anyone

Review: the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it 's only 80 minutes long and when it 's overyou 're glad that you did n't waste more than an hour and a half of your time.it 's nothing more than a bad rip - off of , " jaws" ( and i think that 's being kind . )it was written by david e .kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror - comedy butfails at both , miserably.i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once .the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda ."the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt )flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .there 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .as i mentioned before kelley and director steveminor ( h20 ) do n't go for a serious approach towards the material butthey also do n't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they 're all basically idiots .if they had any brains the croc would n't have been that much of a challenge to catchand they would n't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movie .basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
