Review: i do n't expect much from eddie murphy these days .for the past four years , the gods of cinema -- or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates -- have allowed him to make one bad movie after another .such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once gr

Review: a number of critics have decided that it 's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound - alike , disposable teen fluff like " head over heels , " " boys and girls , " " down to you " and " she 's all that . " while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not .i first saw him in the independent dark comedy " the house of yes , " where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america 's freakiest families .prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown - up movies to show the non - believers that he has what it takes ." summer catch " certainly wo n't help his case .inoffensive , but utterly generic ,the baseball - related romantic comedy does little more than kill time .the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big - time baseball star .ryan 's preoccupation with his new honey - bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team .it 's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad ,bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates .the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character - heavy baseball movie like " bull durham , " but have n't got a clue how to get there . andso they glide from one clich ?to the next for 108 minutes .the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center - fielder from texas .in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon - fighting riley finn from " buffy the vampire slayer , " hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , " he does have a nice ass .a bubble butt ."when lillard gives him an " are you insane ?" look , blucas calmly says , " it 's nothing sexual , " then goes on to evaluate the hind - ends of some other players , including lillard 's .speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie .the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt - butts were employed for a couple of semi - nude shots .blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film .sick of hearing teammates make " fat chick " jokes, he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply - sized ladies .while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie .trivial tidbit : " summer catch " marks a scooby doo summit .marc blucas appears in " jay and silent bob strike back " as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr .plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon .
