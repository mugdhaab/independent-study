Review: a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ?s and stock characters of this genre . though it 's a well - written and well - acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it 's made for the gentle art - house set , those who do n't want something too disturbing to think about . it 's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self - absorbed that he 's threatened by his department store floor - walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer . she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self - absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs . the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband 's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet . she now wants her own identity and her independence . the film looked like the usu

Review: synopsis : committed to an asylum, the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) . abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure . de sade 's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer - collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis ' work , permanently . review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene . but " quills " also details the marquis ' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses . the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie 's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to c

Review: what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection .sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better - made film that is not as thought - provoking .the thin red line is flawedbut it provokes .terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war .unlike this year 's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste .while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is .saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs .one message is not necessarily more correct than the other .it just depends on one 's point of view .in malick 's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll 's cinematography is beyond lush .the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go .in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place .they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying .all that separates them is war .the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice - overs .unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice - overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary .dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur .instead , he gets distracting self - consciousness . aside from that , malick 's direction is stunning .the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary .sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances .penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he can not win his battle .john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles .ultimately however , the thin red line 's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama .it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind .has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ?what malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .
