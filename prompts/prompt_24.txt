Review: forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken - bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ?surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller 's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above sc

Review: call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co - star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word / jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . when a

Review: toward the bottom of the ' 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .this carl " apollo creed" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs .evil establishment crook , and relies on all the ' 80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , " you tore his arm off !" jackson replies , " he had a spare ."jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take ityou 're not one of dellaplane 's friends . "" not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .and of course it turns out stone is mrs .dellaplane .faux pas , jackson . ..not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .it 's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane 's nightclub .after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation ."he responds , " you 're getting one , " and it 's damn clever because he 's sitting down at the time .prince would n't even let out an innuendo that lameand he 's the king of the horndogs .. .or at least the prince .it 's a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they 're given , there 's not much room for improvement .my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone 's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head ."jackson 's response is , " i think i felt that way once .they called it love ."you 'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !
