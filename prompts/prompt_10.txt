Review: renee zellweger stars as sonia , a young jewish wife and mother frustrated by the constraints of her hasidic community in brooklyn .her husband ( glenn fitzgerald ) is a religious scholar whose all - in - a - day's - work attitude on sex fails to tame the " fire " she feels within , as so she confesses to the rebbe ( after hearing her fiery confession , the rebbe suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wife -- and dies the next morning ) .sensing her frustration , her husband 's brother ( christopher eccleston ) gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange for raw , passionless sex that just fans sonia 's still - burning flame .on the job , sonia befriends ramon ( allen payne ) , a cool blast of hunky puerto rican water who does his own jewelry designs when not working as a grunt in an upscale jewelry store .can fire - taming be far be that far behind for the ever - smoldering sonia ?just about everything in writer - director boaz yakin 's rings false , starting with the improbably cast zellweger , who does an adequate enough acting job but simply looks too waspy for the role .a better fit would have been julianna margulies , who outshines zellweger as sonia 's take - no - crap sister - in - law .some of sonia 's baby steps toward liberation , such as indulging in a non - kosher egg roll in chinatown , come off as silly .yakin attempts to spice up the proceedings with a touch of magical realism -- in the form of the recurring presence of sonia 's long - dead brother 's ghost -- make the story feel even more trite than it already is ."i did n't know what to expect .it 's like something you chase for so long , but then you do n't know how to react when you get it .i still do n't know how to react ."--michaeljordan , on winning his first nba championship in 1991 ...or , my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997
