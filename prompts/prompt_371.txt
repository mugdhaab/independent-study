Review: "the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .it 's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .there are certainly better things you can do with your time .actually , if y

Review: capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi .simmer for 100 minutes .yields :zilch .the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen - minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud .it 's hard to make a good action - adventure movie that does n't simply recycle its predecessors , and i 've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully .the phantom , allegedly based on the long - running comic of the same name , does n't even bother to be graceful .it 's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i 'll try .the film opens up with a " prelude " sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice - over to compensate for whatever got thrown out .we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck - chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note - for - note , possibly even shot - for - shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- andthen goes on to rip off the rope - bridge scene from " sorcerer " as well !sorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain .both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i 've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go .anyway ,the cinematic theft does n't stop there . or at least the lack of inspiration .there is n't a single thing here we have n't seen , and it 's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest .we have ( where 's my list ? )a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr .no than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary - hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself .what else is there ?the plot is a waste of time .the sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey .there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked --and i 'm sure once mike andthe ' bots get the cash , they 'll stick it on their sked .the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he 's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another .all i can say is that i pray this is n't the beginning of the end for him --although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic - book super - hero movie .
