Review: the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire - fu copycats . it 's not a pretty death , and it 's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . sometimes , the mix results in a mind - blowing spectacle unlike any other . quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999 's the matrix , can be a real gem . but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . mostly it 's laughable . in hollywood 's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , f

Review: die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film 's pathetic screenplay .every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs .so much for the script .how about the action ?well , let 's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator --all standouts for their hair - raising suspense .by contrast , harlin does n't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so badit 's good .you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .
