Review: in zoolander , the world 's most successful , influential and intellectually - challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , " is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? " obviously , the film 's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature - length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short - film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ?no ,of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more .much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie .it 's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut - busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek 's model roommates alldie in a tragic " gasoline fight " accident -- a riotously funny take - off of tommy hilfiger ads ) .but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused .better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three - minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag .zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs .fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed .enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight .on the trail of mugatu 's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller 's real - life wife christine taylor ) , and she 's hoping to use mugatu 's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme .much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today .wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel .ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr .evil upstages everyone in austin powers .jerry stiller -- ben 's dad who 's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek 's slimy agent maury ballstein .even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large - assed masseuse .as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he 's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one - liners .unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here .maybe it 's just because i ca n't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who has n't had sex in two years .she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would 've added real comic substance to the flimsy role .while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days .zoolander 's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction .
