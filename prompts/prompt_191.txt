Review: after enduring mariah carey 's film debut , glitter , i 'm reminded of a bit from chris rock 's bigger and blacker . in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that do n't mean it should be done . " to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly do n't mean it should be done . sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles ' a hard day 's night to the spice girls ' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . the film is inexplicably set in the 80s ,a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . worse yet, everyone 's speaking late 90s hip - hop slang in what should be 1983 . meant to be pa

Review: i must admit i 'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemptionhe justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . the story of serendipity is simple . two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .

Review: in _ daylight _ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , buthe covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _ daylight _ movie posters on it .i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out .it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering .so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably wo n't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie ," so i signed up .all in all , i do n't think i got that bad of a deal , either .rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _ dragon :the bruce lee story _ and , more recently ,_ dragonheart _ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ?you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after - effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _ cliffhanger _ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed .when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out .there are other similarities to _ cliffhanger _ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _ cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _ daylight _ 's bad guy is mother nature .in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _ cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film " sequels " do to their predecessors .the first half - hour of _ daylight _ is setup .subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled .we meet all the important people . . .toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others .we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons .and then , thirty minutes into the film ,_ boom _ .and it 's a big one .> from there on in, it 's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly - style .again .. .there 's nothing new here .and yet there does n't need to be .the fun of _ daylight _ is not in the story but in the execution .the special - effects are first - rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together.once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .this review is copyright 1996 by christophere .meadows .permission granted for distribution through rec .arts .movies .reviews and all associated archival .permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached .all other rights reserved to the author .
