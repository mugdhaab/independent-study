Review: so ask yourself what " 8 mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?is it about the business itself ,how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big - town americana , there 's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wo n't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ?or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?i 'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . i 'm talking about films like " 8 mm " and its director , joel schumacher . with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence

Review: apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i do n't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i 've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye 's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . it 's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton 's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard

Review: in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .was it " deep " ?nope .however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .which was true .if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ;mr . lovell gave it** * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be ." ; mr .travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .i admire mr .burton for trying to do more then entertain , butthe result is a mess .nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .alas, these are only hints .there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .
