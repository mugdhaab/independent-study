Review: writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) starring : jamie lee curtis ,william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechosoi suppose i 'm not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it 's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron 's early works . in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action / horror / paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally - threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . no such thing w

Review: " very bad things , " is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i could n't help but be won over by the material . the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . the groom - to - be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding - obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone 's terror , she is killed . as robert puts it : " there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever

Review: let 's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale .with no new eye - candy for four weeksstraight , we 've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi - nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers .sigh .thank god for desperado .the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi -- director robert rodriguez 's notorious $ 7000 debut -- stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name .he 's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case .( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . )so , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex - mex version of the punisher , if you will .there is n't much of an emotional core to desperado .rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo .( and sergio leone . . . and sam peckinpah . . . )some may wince at the body count -- at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate -- but it 's all played for laughs .big , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films .sick , slick fun .
