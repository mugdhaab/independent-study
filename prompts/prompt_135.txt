Review: as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan 's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr .  nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . once again , chan 's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star 's character simply jackie , with no last name . this jackie is a world - class chef who co - hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter 's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . the sole purpose of mr . nice guy 's existence are chan 's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . direct

Review: i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) , except if you 're child ?in which case it would be called experimenting .rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . hardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed .despite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over .well , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life .and it 's sweet .drew barrymore who shone in ?ever after ' is wonderful as ?josie , grossy ' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter .it addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting .hard to believe , but possible .there may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss .so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it .either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending .
