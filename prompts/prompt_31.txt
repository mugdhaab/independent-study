Review: it 's a good thing most animated sci - fi movies come from japan , because " titan a. e. " is proof that hollywood does n't have a clue how to do it .i do n't know what this film is supposed to be about .from what i can tell it 's about a young man named kale who 's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re - generating what is left of the human race .that 's a fine premise for an action - packed sci - fi animated movie , but there 's no payoff .the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason .so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double - crosses than you can shake a stick at .there 's so much pointless sci - fi banterit 's too much to take .the galaxy here is a total rip - off of the " star wars " universe the creators do n't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring .despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it 's just not an interesting movie .
