Review: like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art .it is one of those few movies of the 80 's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence .why is this such a good film ?there are almost too many reasons to explain .the story : court composer salieri ( f. murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer .salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart 's brilliance and ingenious .we travel through mozart 's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise .the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language .this performance earned him a well deserved oscar .tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh .he 's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth .jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned andmom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm .the movie : every element of this movie works .the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart 's original music ) .while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking .this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come .ad2am "i almost lost my nose ...and i like it .i like breathing through it ."-jack nicholson , chinatown
