Review: bob the happy bastard 's quickie review : rush hourso what 's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ?they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter ,and it 's director brett rainer . rush hour features jackie chan in his first u .  s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who 's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate 's daughter . of course , the fbi is upset that he 'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that 's chris tucker . what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity( " i 'm michael jackson , you tito .

Review: this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue - collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind - set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story :it is old news . the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her does n't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . the introduction of the wise - guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experien

Review: a cinematic version of one of john irving 's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of " simon birch , " the treatment is merely " suggested by , " rather than strictly based on , the book .suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed " the world according to garp , " sold the rights to his novel " a prayer for owen meany " to the disney machine for $ 1 million , but would n't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names .that 's an odd decision -- irving claims it 's to protect both himself and the novel -- but it 's one that does n't unduly harm the finished product .irving 's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters ."a prayer for owen meany " is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy -- called simon birch in the film version -- who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high - pitched falsetto voice , " like strangled mice ."simon believes himself to be " god 's instrument , " placed on this earth to somehow effect god 's plan .simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally .smith 's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for " simon birch " ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function -- smith 's acting abilities are limited at best .another drawback is that in the book , simon 's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters -- in careful , loving detail . watching " simon birch , " however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended .simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith 's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one - liners he 's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film 's director and screenwriter .fortunately , simon birch is n't the real star of the film that bears his name .simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co - stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny .first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( " jurassic park " ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon 's best friend , joe .mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent .ashley juddpositively beams in her role as rebecca , joe 's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben .david strathairn and jan hooks play the town 's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .there 's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from .. .well , that would be telling .perhaps " suggested by " the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since " simon birch " only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon 's extraordinary life .the film also changes the book 's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon 's lot .the flavor of irving 's original novel remains , however -- the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .
