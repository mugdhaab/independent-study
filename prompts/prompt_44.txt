Review: i 'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters . in _ the wedding singer _ , she was julia gulia . in _ never been kissed_, she 's josie grossie . future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo - jo .  .  . aw forget it . i 'll stick to my day job . this is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters are n't teens . drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it 's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters . the story she 's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making . she is to return to high school as a student and explain what 's really going on . the irony is that drew 's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back . when she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and

Review: synopsis : in " sooner than you think " america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs .a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them .comments : so , what do an ex - gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ?why , they 're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks !they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one anothera lathe marines in james cameron 's aliens .yes , it 's blade squad , the fox network 's wednesday night movie of the week .this " movie , " marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars ."how can a movie have guest stars ?"you may ask .well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie .blade squad is dumb .blade squad is loud .blade squad is obnoxious .blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long - lived tv series .why not ?after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( " knight rider " ) , fast helicopters ( " airwolf " ) , and super fast motorcycles ( " street hawk " ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past .so , why not crimefighters with jet - powered roller blades ?to be honest , as a made - for - tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable .the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half - interested .i 'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it .i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad .i can remember liking " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 .and , although this is n't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book 's terrific two - year beginning ) .but , i digress .despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series .one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer 's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background .oh yeah ,dylan 's " knockin ' on heaven 's door " and bowie 's" i 'm afraid of americans " are used here ,in rather poor taste .two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound .the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .characters ' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible .during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . when a character spoke , the song 's volume dropped but did not disappear . as soon as that character finished speaking , the song 's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke .this sounds trivial , i 'm sure , but it distracted me immensely .finally , this is commercial television .foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television .thus , do n't use foul language in a made - for - tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner .in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets .when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car 's horn off - screen to muffle the word out .in a " seinfeld " episode , this technique proved funny ; here ,it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably .perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics ' 2099 series of comics .make up a bunch of new bad words for the future .this way , you do n't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language .compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp .when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .( review written august 12 , 1998 )
