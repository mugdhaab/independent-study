Review: arye cross and courteney cox star asa pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc .review == = = = =well , if you have n't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , orif you do n't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages .however , if you 've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film .this of course does n't mean its bad .some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what 's the point ?arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love .kevin pollack is the stereotypical female - fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which were n't very funny .couteney cox is the stereotypical career - minded woman who falls in love .julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman .( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical .this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . )so what is good about the movie ?well as i said there are a few amusing moments .surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film .also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual .gee , this is really short .not much to say about the film really .it is just kind of there .watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i would n't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .
