Review: ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ?it 's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . i felt the same way watching drowning mona . skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . even the police chief drives one . there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . there are some sig

Review: after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel 's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america .muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia .she is often the target of her father 's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage .her self - loathing is such that only being wedshall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired .after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel 's wedding unfolds from there .toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted .collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character .she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma ,easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance .collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene .muriel 's father , bill " the battler " heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician / developer .while chumming around with young fans and crowing ' you ca n't beat progress ' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments .rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel 's cheeky new friend in the film .she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off - screen .muriel 's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two - dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan 's scripting muriel 's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm .hogan 's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . hogan 's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel 's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window - shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her .the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .muriel 's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p .j .hogan .on my four star scale , i give muriel 's wedding three stars .
