Review: up until about a year ago , john travolta 's career consisted of those " look who 's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who 's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight - to - the - cutout - bin album aptly named " sizeis n't everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . but now travolta 's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . four words : contract with the devil . and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich 's " contract with america .

Review: has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small - town deputy sheriff corralled into co - coaching the school 's hastily formed soccer team . his partner - in - crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer - city audience is to teach them something neat . like soccer . most of the good - natured gags are of the fast - motion variety , such as runaway cows and out - of - control lawnmowers . kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what 's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . instead of a peppy pop score , w

Review: has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot - driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 's lame brained men in black .will this guy ever get a real role ?he has the bruce willis syndrome .the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . .you know .enemy was one of the worst films of last year .not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight ,the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i did n't like how smith always magically out - smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .somehow , quality ca n't overshadow quantity .
