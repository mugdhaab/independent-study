Review: linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma 's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she 's still in fine formas bethany , an abortion clinic worker who 's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany 's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church - the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him / herself , but he /she is .  .  . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double - duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith 's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and ve

Review: director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film-- the dreadful comedy steal big , steal little-- was funny .keanu" i 'd rather play music than play another action hero " reevesis the grad student on the run , who , along with his superfluous sidekick ( rachel weisz ) , has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks .( the mushroom - cloud explosion is a knock - out and easily the best part of the movie .or , as one audience member succinctly summed it up :" whoa . " ) false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run , fleeing over open drawbridges , across icy lakes , and through the corridors of power at a top - secret , underground energy facility .aiding and abetting is the team 's shady mentor , played in an excellent - but - so-what performance by morgan freeman .( brit brian cox is also about , as the behind - the - scenes bad guy .he has some fun fiddling with a southern accent . ) unfunny , overscored , and without a single shred of suspense , chain reaction is * the * summer movie to walk out on . if you make it to the end , a mess of cross - cutting involving another imminent explosion , you 'll hear somebody say " i guess it 's time to go ." heed that warning .
