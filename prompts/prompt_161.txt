Review: synopsis :in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month - long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation . fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college - aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom do n't speak chinese . the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters . opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven . sometimes it 's a character sketch . a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family . fang 's family is thoroughly americanized . fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues

Review: this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney 's live- action george of the jungle . tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough 's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill - timed of any tarzan adventure so far . badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it 's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . furthermore , it 's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . and , while i 'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the fi

Review: an indian runner was more than a courier .he * became * the message he was carrying .what danger is a bear , to a message ?i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna - marrying , loudmouth .but all that has changed now .the guy has grown up .and that 's not all .it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication .one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper .but , no .this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash .the focus of the story is two brothers .david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer .viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he ca n't name , much less resolve .the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line .it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared .the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere .it is n't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them .life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems .this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face .in fact , i 'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing .there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw .i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free - form sections which also work very well .the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do -- this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all .in my opinion , it is worth full - price admission .
