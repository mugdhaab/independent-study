Review: a pseudo - intellectual film about the pseudo - intellectual world of art magazines ,high art is as wasted as its drug - addled protagonists . in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko 's script or direction makes you care much about either character .  living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . 24-year - old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live - in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( a

Review: will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . for a movie character , that 's usually a death sentence . it 's a trait associated with what my brother calls " too good for this world " movies , like phenomenon or powder . forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will does n't die . this is no formula movie . in fact , it 's quite fresh and original . it 's a character study more than anything , and that 's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co - star ben affleck . will works whatever kind of job he can get . first he 's a janitor , then he works construction . off - screenhe speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . on - screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized - hemingway fashion . lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . having confirmed he 's not a fluk

Is this a positive movie review?
Review: according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors " hope to restore good old - fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness ." hmm .you never know , they just might be on to something .what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever - contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own .but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it .it 's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch .that 's a shame , because , in the first ten minutesor so the film promises to be a lot more .woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson .the movie opens in the fifties with roy 's dad dishing out the reader 's digest / gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever .the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken .it 's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good- he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy .mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy 's hand .then it 's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand .he 's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) ,an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege .so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way .with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that 's . . .dumb and dumber .yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle .so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen .get set for stock fish - out - of - water situations when city - boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour - socking .now , do n't get me wrong , there 's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy .the trouble is that these jokes are n't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction .it lurches from sports movie to amish - mocking to road - trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together .some gags fall flat from a lack of build - up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply do n't do anything .why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ?why two of these ?why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ?the film is full of these half - thought - through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , " would n't that be funny ? " .well , no , actually .the actors do n't do the movie much favours either .woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer - creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . .please ) .even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie 's climax .all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no - hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance .we 'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( " strictly bowling " , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy .the flying inkpot 's rating system :* wait for the video .** a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !** * pretty good , bring a friend .*** * amazing , potent stuff .**** * perfection . see it twice .
