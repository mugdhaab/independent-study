Review: the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful filmthat made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , " can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ?"the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are " him " and " her " ( during the bad times ) , and when they are " us " ( during the good times ) . the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marr

Review: play it to the bone is a punch - drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men ca n't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rockybut two . rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . .  . something that he has not yet successfully achieved . rocky no .  2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince 's ex - girlfriend , grace . both men are nearing the end of their " almost " careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity . when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement . our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot

Review: bruce lee was a bigger - than - life martial artist ( and ) actor .bruce 's unique character ( i .e . ,self - produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee .the story is told from his wife linda 's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee 's life .however , you ca n't helpbut like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character .i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee 's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english .it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else .scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all - white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes .it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes .in conclusion , the movie was well made, it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor .and the fighting scenes were all excellent .so go see it and enjoy the movie .p . s .if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven .
