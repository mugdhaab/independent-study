Review: i think that any competent member of the human race who 's ever seen a movie -- any movie -- could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . even though i try very hard to not predict films as i 'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . but i do n't care . not even a little . my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . 2 ) drew barrymore is great . 3 ) the movie is so funny . there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard. i have n't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy - go - lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really

Is this a positive movie review?
Review: if there 's one thingi just ca n't stand , it 's a film that oozes with sentimentality . here 's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . what reminded me was that i was n't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un - cute( i detest the word " cute " but i 've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) . it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intende

Is this a positive movie review?
Review: contact ( pg )there 's a moment late in robert zemeckis 's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place .we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops .anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear -- the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead .it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment .jodie foster stars as dr .ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals .and i mean life -- after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie 's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth .after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport .from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci - fi hook .the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power .the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right .it would be easy for scripters james v .hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane .in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so -- there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults .the complex role of ellie is an actress 's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo - in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge .she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge .we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far .contact is clearly foster 's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles .matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer - ellie romance , is the film 's weakest subplot ) .john hurt is effectively creepy as s .r .hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine .most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr .david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances .zemeckis comes off of his three - year break in top shape .always known as a director of effects - laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact 's visual effects are quite stunning .the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis 's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick 's yet more wondrously pure . and zemeckis does n't resist the urge to use the always - interesting incorporate - actors - into - existing - film - footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump .effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump .it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it 's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised .the thought - provoking , two - hour - plus contact is a much - welcome change of pace from summer no - brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also is n't entertaining .for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it 's being sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the universe . " and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .
