Review: about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out" i hope she gets killed now !"at that point it hit me :i did n't care for any of the characters being played by actors i did n't really like . when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he 's being played by sidney poitier , you knowsomething 's rotten in the state of denmark . every year , a couple films like this are released . you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi - promising premise , some big - name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . this was the third one of ' 97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the s

Review: no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again -see: i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society 's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , butwhat 's remarkable is how timeless this film is . the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - was n't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it 'd be kinda different ( a given ) . it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim - witted young man with big dreams . in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson (

Review: razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .official release : halloween reviewed by vince yim` you think you know all about vampires . . .believe me . . .you know f* ck all . 'with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .so , what 's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?with that out of the way , let me say this .this film is bad .this film is really , really bad .yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ?buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ?any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . period .razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , does n't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the ` opium of the peoples ' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .but aside from that , it does n't stray too far away from horror film conventions .that is , unless that is intentional .razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .you ca n't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .you 'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .you 'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .and then , there 's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin - tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you 've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .but in case you really care , she 's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so - called illuminati , and she 's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .almost destined for cult - status , the film 's campy , cheesy overtonesactually work towards the film .while this may not necessarily be the film you 'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .
