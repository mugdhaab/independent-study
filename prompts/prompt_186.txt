Review: i 've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i 'm watching a 40-year - old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy - feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready - made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams ' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self - indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly - laugh comedy served up with high energy . williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda 's ad for a

Review: romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top - notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleedingdid not : a solid , well - written screenplay . call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer do n't seem to mix well . gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name does n't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . gary oldman 's p

Review: bob the happy bastard 's quickie review :the mummy brendan fraser 's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone .. .fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) .it 's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in .but who cares ,the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to ityou ca n't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon .fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground .basically , it 's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress .his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible .of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising 's kevin j .o'connor ) and some " americans " . . .and guess what ?yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc .fire flies from the sky , flesh - eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep 's plan begins to unfold .ok , so it 's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough .the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz is n't half bad either .the action is pretty intense( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror - loving folks as well .no , it 's no phantom menace beater , but if you 're looking for a solid warm - up to the summer movie season , you wo n't find a better film under wraps than the mummy .if this does n't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .
