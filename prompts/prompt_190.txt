Review: good films are hard to find these days . great films are beyond rare . proof of life , russell crowe 's one - two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems.  a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true .  consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe 's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan 's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . i have n't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah 's masterpiece , the getaway . but enough with the gossip , let 's get to the review . the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south americ

Review: gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film 's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . .  . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . nobody can save this bomb from it 's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious - type of film . it 's just a pile of dreck .  .  . an ill - conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . " end of days " aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one - dimensional star who is past his prime . .  . which makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it 's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . it 's just dreary and unwatchable .  .  . a big - b

Review: apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic filmthis summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) .director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet .perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . .all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles .apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of usspaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) .jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon .suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home .. . if they ever reach it .ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly.audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space .also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 .the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and dramavery well, thanks to film - music maestro james horner .watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film .a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script .those who consider themselves ` scientifically illiterate ' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film .you should enjoy it .
