Review: over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind 's nuclear testing . partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . now it 's 14 years after toho 's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . in emmerich 's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the s

Is this a positive movie review?
Review: no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan 's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe 's novel about young lad francie brady 's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie 's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie 's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them

Review: " return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once .the film tells the story of a low - budget horror movie being filmed at the closed - down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .but what the cast and crew do n't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again .on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on .watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i could n't help but take notice that the killer 's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 ." on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout .unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat .and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind - the - scenes " look at an exploitation film being made .the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be .and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever,and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time .there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through .if you see the film , or have seen it , you 'll know what i mean .the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place .but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene .well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in .but other than that two - minute distraction , " return to horror high , " iscertainly no great shake .note :look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film .and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . .literally .
