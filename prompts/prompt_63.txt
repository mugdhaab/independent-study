Review: would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you 'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta - jones ?let me tell you what reality is . reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . that 's reality . america 's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also - ran , presumably because she wears horn - rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh - huh ) . the plot follows two married , mega - movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta - jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle 's release , a film called time over time . the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( t

Review: susan granger 's review of " the closet " ( miramax films ) in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovershe 's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management . as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather - clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon 's boss . when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job backbut he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . even his ex - wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevil

Review: to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .also , a beautifully anti - climactic ending .not to say it did n't look intriguing when i saw the previews .so much for truth in advertising .roland emmerich , who 's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co - writed and directed this inane sci - fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .it would n't be till present day ( ' 94 ) till they would actually figure it out .they 're decipherer ?a slightly - neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr .dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who 's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?so there is a hokey ending !duh !he figures it out in about a minute .yea .and then they get a suicidal colonel or something, " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat - top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .why a suicidal colonel ?for the ending !you 'll get the hang of this .they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .after an overdone special effects thing , they 're . . .inside a goddam pyramid .so they went to egypt ,right ?wrong .they 're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .yea .also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .an anti - climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo - pseudo - pseudo - character development .by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i do n't know , the " outer limits " or something .the script 's terrible .the special effects are okay , but nothing great .the story 's so weak that it 's almost opaque.the whole experience just is n't worth it unless you 're so bored that you 'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . .or this .i 'd pick this , obviously , but still ,it 's just not fun at all .and i ca n't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
