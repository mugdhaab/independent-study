Review: " crazy / beautiful " suffers from the damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - don't syndrome . after a spate of flighty , cookie - cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special . "even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie - jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re - shoot scenes and cut footage to " tone things down . " needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . "we were trying to make a cautionary tale , " he told newsweek , " and we could n't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from .  " regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . " crazy

Review: gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie 's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement . as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . gord does n't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . " tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green 's primal scream . so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ?it 's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and greensure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there 's little about green 's mania on dis

Review: 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .i 'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i 'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i 've already wasted . while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short.this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels .while the story is n't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better, 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .james spader 's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron( in her first role ) .you know a movie is n't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .even if they are both gorgeous .i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment .not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .or at least not all of it anyway .
