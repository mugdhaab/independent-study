Review: deserves recognition for : achieving the near - impossible task of making a grander monument to self - love than steven seagal 's on deadly ground . capsule review : a question : after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld , what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post - apocalyptic movie thinking ?in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave , costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee 's uniform and gradually turns a nuked - out usa into an idealized hippy - dippy society . ( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re - inventing polyester .  )when he 's not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust - no - one 90 's ; but by the time the second hour rolled around ,i was reduced to sitting

Review: "oh my god , i sounded just like a mother !" mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . "did n't i sound just like a mother ? "" you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly . "i know , but i still ca n't believe it . i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ?"marty , you see , is a grown - up twin . although his sister , who thinks she is jackie - o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes .  mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean - spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . the daughter 's fantasy of being jackie - o is probably the most sane part of her being . mrs . pascal is the sort that will not letjackie - o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is ke

Review: susan granger 's review of " bread and tulips " ( first look pictures ) in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice .for the first time in years , rosalba 's on her own when she 's abandoned at a highway rest area .although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing - supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she 's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she 's never visited .rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning .to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) .film - maker silvio soldinigently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle - aged , middle - class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red - and - white dress with platform - soled espadrilles .the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low - key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage - therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber - turned - private eye who 's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who 's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house .on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " bread and tulips " is a beguiling , escapist 8 .as the summer ends , it 's a magical getaway for mature audiences . .
