Question: Answer the following yes/no question.
Is this a positive movie review?
Review: the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate .people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future .after a sort of confusing bit involving fake - looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds .the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth .the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element .the plot in this movie really is n't that important to the thing though .this movie has very good special effects , for the most part .the techno - ish music in the background fits the mood very well .bruce willis is an illegal taxi - cab driver in a futuristic new york city .one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk .this movie is about what happens .the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations .also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end .some characters are just plain strange including a highly - energetic deejay in drag .bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does .the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down .it is one of those sci - fi films where you 'll be saying " cool " followed by a " what the hell ? ! ? ! " .i give the fifth element .
