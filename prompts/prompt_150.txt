Review: jean - claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun . his latest film , " knock off , " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless . you ca n't really blame van damme . no one , i suspect , has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . and even his sidekick co - star , " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin ' copies " schneider , does what 's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man . no ,the problem with the film is its direction . the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible .  .  . and it goes downhill from there !five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes . van damme does n't land his first kick until after thirty -- too late for most action fans -- and by the time the hour mark has rolled around ,your jaw w

Review: in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy 's jack ryan series , _ the_fugitive _ , and last year 's smash _ air_force_one _ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . apparently , it was just lying dormant . with ivan reitman 's enjoyable romantic comedy / adventure_ six_days ,_ seven_nights _ ,the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropicswhose broken - down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt - of - the - earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is ex

Review: buffalo ?66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .the truth is he is n't married .to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you do n't need money to make a good film .buffalo ?66 does n't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .gallo 's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .gallo and ricci arrive at his parent 's house , andsome extremely funny scenes take place within the house .ricci 's performance during the scene at gallo 's parent 's home are very well done .there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine.gallo 's character is developed very well .the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .this character seemed very realistic to me .ricci 's character is funny and different .she does n't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves.buffalo ?66 is n't all laughs though .many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .gallo 's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .i really would have liked to see gallo 's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .overall , buffalo ?66 is n't as good as some people put it up to be .the bottom line-a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .
