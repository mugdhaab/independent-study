Review: robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry 's best friends . stockard channing plays verna , harry 's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames ' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . g

Review: tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it 's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non - traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . it 's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all - but - screaming , " look ! art ! " ) , al

Review: some movies ' pre - release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they 're finally released , everyone just goes along with it .thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sansthe razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations .last year it was the thin red line .this year 's " winner " is the hurricane ,pure unadulterated tripethat is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool .acclaimed director norman jewison 's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movieswithout any of the fun .and that 's supposed to be ok because , see , it 's a true story .it 's about rubin " hurricane " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! )detective ( dan hedaya ) who 's had it in for the " big - shot " hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self - defense but who cares , right ? )when rubin was only ten .he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna - be detectives .lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well - off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education .lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin 's autobiography .immediately thereafter , schreiber 's character tells lesra " sometimes we do n't pick the books we read , they pick us ." hmmm .after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin 's innocence and launch their own full - scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him .they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? )and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane 's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .of course , we 're already told that he 's innocent .a movie like this is especially frustrating because we 're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .all too obviously , we 're getting the hollywood watered- down version .that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .it 's almost cruel .the melodrama is n't of the entertaining kind either ; it 's the hokey , rammed - down - your - throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity .witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo - saintliness of our four protagonists .the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie exceptit 's a no - frills courtroom movie .it 's formula stripped to the bare necessities .you have your wrongly accused black man .you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .but there 's nothing else .you 'd expect some sort of involving investigation .but that 's not necessary since we 're implicitly informed of his innocence .thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .brooding to himself .brooding to other inmates .brooding to lesra .brooding to lesra 's canadian friends .brooding in letters .i do n't think i 'll ever look at brooding the same way again .it was n't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane 's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition .i wanted something to happen .as for washington 's performance in the title role -- i figured i 'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it 's received -- he is top notch , thoughstill boring .how is that possible ?well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly .unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap .what a waste of a great performer .speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ?he 's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ?to call his character ( along with schreiber 's and unger 's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement .all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do - gooders come .if they 're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ?look : if you 're going to make a formula movie , do n't undermine the formula .courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous .not only is it trite , it 's boring .
