Review: at the outset of swordfish , john travolta 's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this ?by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie 's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is. this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly tha

Review: i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .take the professional , for example .it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .it 's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle - aged man and a twelve - year - old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d .e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda 's father tried to rip him off .leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .writer / director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close - ups and evocative lighting .but beneath the shiny wrapper , there is n't nearly as much going onas besson would like us to believe .the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he 's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she does n't have too much to work with , either .besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .gary oldman 's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild - eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .there is n't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which is n't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve - year - old in a really distasteful way .there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda 's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he 's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman 's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9 mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world ca n't disguise that fact .
