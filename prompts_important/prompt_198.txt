Review: whether you like the beatles or not , nobody wants to see the bee gee 's take on some of the fab four 's best known songs . well , maybe that 's not true . .  . maybe you 're curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose . you just have to know how bad bad can be . if that 's the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so )that sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs .  derived from the lyrics of various beatles ' songs , sgt . pepper 's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 . of course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story does n't correlate to the song at al

Review: call it touched by a demon . gregory hoblit 's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact , there 's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit withthe lion 's share of the weirdness distilled out . ( remember bob ? )the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it 's consistently interesting, it 's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around .

Review: i had an epiphany today .it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill ."it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it 's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .too bad i did n't trust my own instincts when something - or - the - other possessed me to see this movie .i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow ." that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozythat tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .i wish i 'd seen it when it was halloween .at least i would have been forgiving .hey , tis the season .the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously was n't going anywhere .now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .that 's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that 's different from utterly nonsensical .hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .. .well let 's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh - so - cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .riiiiight .y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .yeah .just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .ooooooo .hint : blood and guts only work a few times .sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it 's just ketchup and props and you 've got to come up with something better than that .there were just too many things in this movie that we 've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .each was more predictable than the last .why did n't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?sheesh .was i grossed out ?yes .did i get spooked a few times ?yes .but why ?i get really disturbed when there is no why .when there were n't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which was n't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .the characters were incredibly flat and cliched . not to mention downright annoying .you 've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they 're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .and of course , all three gals are babes .i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .keep that up , geoff , and you 'll qualify for the next batman venture .the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .and famke jansen (sp ? )because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante 's peak " three times for him : ) .all right , i concede .there were a couple of things i enjoyed .that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .i probably wo n't ride a rollercoaster for a while .and the machine they used to drive geoffrey 's character mad ( see , i do n't even remember their names ) .the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .it would n't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .thank god they did n't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .god , there is no hope .
