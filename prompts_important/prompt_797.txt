Review: shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . why would you want more of it now that your english grade does n't count on it ?if this is your attitude , then i 'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh 's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open - minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has we dthe king 's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother 's hands . hamlet , enlisting the help of his friendhoratio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery .  .  . . and the game is afoot .  .  .  . the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes .

Review: when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in " jackie brown " , he immediately signed up for a little film called " american perfekt " . this was almost two years ago . i waited patiently for the film to be released , but it never was . finally , i forgot about it . the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , " american perfekt " . i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee , rushed home to view it . having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release . " american perfekt " is a jumbled mess . the storyline is non - existent . it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on. and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort . it wants to get by on quirkyness and so - called charm alone , and it just does n't work . robert forster plays a psychiatris

Review: when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! 'i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead .what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script .this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ?four weddings and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between .hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings ' .he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck .unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , butfortunately it works well for him in this movie .if only he would dither a little less .julia knows this role well .the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love .there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness .how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with .the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels .how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment .how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice .
