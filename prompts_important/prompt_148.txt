Review: warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who 's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what 's _really _ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt .  )instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry .  )it 's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulwort

Review: i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie .  using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super - famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . now , before i continue to ferociously attack what 's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . catherine zeta - jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thie
Important Phrases: a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie, waste of my time, i continue to ferociously attack what 's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably, we 've all seen this a few billion times before and this film does n't break any new ground, the entire production feels contrived, who are not nearly as clever as they think they are, well , you 'd be wrong, takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular, the depths of the boring film abyss, littered of instances, one last complaint :

Review: clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another .midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood - directed film clint is n't even in , andit 's damn good . adapted from a best - selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head .and that 's just the mayor .as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor .like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion .the acting , from big - time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you 'd expect , but it 's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm .cusack plays a free - lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey 's parties .lots of food , beverages and gunplay .yes , an employee of spacey 's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead .it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there 's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in .the weird circle of entertainment .this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in .there 's the requisite sexy woman ( alison " nepotist 's daughter " eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite .miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his / her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ?chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie 's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie .there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating .certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey 's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly - guy as the jury 's foreman .it 's herewe realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey 's homosexuality .yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course .midnight in the garden of good and evil is n't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity - directed , true - story best - seller adaptations out there .likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great .in fact , i 'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category .serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !
