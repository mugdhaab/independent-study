Review: when _ star wars _ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space - ships . when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . cool . _ october sky _ offers a much simpler image -- that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then - technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _ october sky _ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm

Review: sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkersthat hamper lumet 's reputation . a stranger among us , 1992 rip - off of peter weir 's witness , belongs to the latter category . the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . that i

Review: "the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we 've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) , man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) .now , " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears .the story , if that 's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king 's wife and is banished from his home land .he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them .eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men .thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth .he 's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he 'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield .that 's basically the entire plot .there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers did n't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story .instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer .the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a storyit becomes a laughing stock .the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting .we do n't get to know any of the charactersand so we do n't care who lives and who dies .the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action - adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels .it was directed by john mctiernan who 's , " the thomas crown affair " is also playing in theaters currently .and it 's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , " the 13th warrior " was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences .it belongs back on the shelf .
