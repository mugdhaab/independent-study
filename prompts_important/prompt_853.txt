Review: by now i figured i 'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half - dozen times -- not that i 'm complaining . to call him the " master of suspense " is an understatement . the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock 's lesser movies , turned out to be one i 'd missed . this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring . the story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband . as mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world . to franz waxman 's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband . "a brief skirmish , and you 'll be lunching at the savoy again , " anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial . gr

Review: " deep rising " gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid - like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring 's " anaconda " -- " deep rising " has no tongue to put in its cheek . folks , we 're only a month into the new year , and already here 's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh - oh -- if these people had seen " titanic , " then maybe they 'd have known to stay home ) when it 's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke jan

Review: after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light - hearted departure for quentin tarantino .it 's more of a ho - hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer .the story introduces us to a street - wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another .she works for a bottom - of - the - barrel airline and receives a minimal salary .but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough - nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope .jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation .soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 through to them under nicolet 's nose , with the help of ordell 's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged - out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) .also entering the picture is a bail - bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i wo n't say ) .the big drop - off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double - crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands .it 's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and does n't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so .there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters .the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof .the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie .a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ?you 've got to commend the acting .jackie brown is a seriously dragged - out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes .tarantino 's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear .jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off - screen , so do n't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath .you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the ` n ' word as part of his regular vocabulary .the acting is the glue that holds everything together .grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970 's , is more than adequate for the title character .in fact , she 's flat - out great . another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug - head who goes over the edge .speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell 's bikini - clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .there 's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .which is a life - saver for mr .tarantino .the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake .but oh well .jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work .let 's just hope that the director has n't gone soft on us .
