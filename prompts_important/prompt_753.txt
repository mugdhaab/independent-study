Review: i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . for all teenagers , it 's almost like a rite of passage . and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . and all of that isterrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . ` american pie ' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose

Review: robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you knowit 's in trouble . jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically " uplifting " film with a fundamental contradiction :the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie does n't realize it . williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high - ranking german officer for his punishment . jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . the announcement ( in english

Review: did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ?that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow .she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder .the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer 's moral dilemmaas he takes a case he thinks he can not win .jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history .he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber .his remorse for his wife 's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 .the background to the case is such .during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke .the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will .when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood .claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail .he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him .ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who can not stand what has happened to him .we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they did n't commit , and von bulow , who he still has n't figured out .dershowitz does n't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case .nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him .together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed .silver 's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film .schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz .there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical .yet , due to glenn close 's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well .the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder does n't fill in the blanks .the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending .the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion .the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz 's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over - simplifies the story and the characters .yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons .as von bulow , he is brutally evil .anti - semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame .irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence .he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder .however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility .there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife 's death by years of neglect and coldness .however , legally , did he do the murder ?schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind .with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind .schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death .for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully .we do n't know what happened .that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow 's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works .in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever .irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .
