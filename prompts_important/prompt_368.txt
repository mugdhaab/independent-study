Review: it 's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half - asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes ' name for making the original live - action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . the original made more than $ 100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of " collectible " items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal - marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas

Review: i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn / tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . it is cute , funny , suspenseful( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . one of the bad guys was a surprise . the pace is fast enough , there are some " action " scenes . i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair !her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . she could use some highlights . they both do fine with their roles : he 's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she 's a hotshot " cub " reporter with the chicago globe . they have great fun trying to out

Review: it 's a shamethe execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there 's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .not that there 's anything wrong with scatology .i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .it 's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .adults ?well , let 's just say most will find it unappetizing.osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .frank 's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .it 's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate 's mouth .like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier 's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?s of that genre .and this is why osmosis jones does n't click .it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .the jokes and puns are lame: osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he does n't look fluish ."and the jokes do n't rise above that level .the live action scenes are no better .frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .he 's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat .it lacks scope and depth .it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
