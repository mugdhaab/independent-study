Review: the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it 's adequately explained by the commercials . with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty - tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a " pageant " , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . and if there was n't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second - rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . ( a heist comedy ?yup . deniro and hoffman are " stealing " the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else .  )wag the dog succeeds because it 's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . ok , maybe i

Review: seen may 2 , 1998 at 3: 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater # 13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $ 5 . [ theater rating :** * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats ] the big - budget , mega - hype " event " movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . gluttony is hollywood 's favorite sin , but it is the movie - goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever - worsening basis . " lost in space " is the latest such offering - a filmso poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre. it 's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wondermentthe genre was meant for . audiences ' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast - paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all

Review: " idle hands " is distasteful , crass and derivative .if an original thought found its way into this horror - comedy it would die of loneliness .plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen - agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo .the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen - agers .the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high - school slacker who 's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed .along the way the hand kills anton 's parents and his two best friends .the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them .that is the level of this 's atrocity 's humor .the movie treats death as a joke ." idle hands " is gruesome and morbid .the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen .it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today 's young people and their values in a satiric vein .however , it 's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people .with the real horrors of the world put before us on television ,a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths ." idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .the time is not right for this type of movie .and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right .this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .
