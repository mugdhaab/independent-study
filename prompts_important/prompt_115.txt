Review: i know that " funnest " is n't a word . " fun " is a noun , and therefore can not be conjugated like an adjective . but that 's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . "no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i 've ever seen !" so to hell with webster 's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i 've seen in a while . i ca n't remember the last time i 've seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy 's farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp - like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and t

Review: forget get carter . instead .  .  .  get me a cup of coffee . what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?when did all of the bad - ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun - toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980 's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary - eyed knuckleheads . the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i do n't mean new york city . get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber - thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80 's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportuni

Review: you 'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .that 's a bit more difficult .the farfetched sci - fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .if you 're not nice to it , you lose .galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks 's spaceballs was to star wars ,an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean - spirited or malintentioned ."the show 's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over ."that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that 's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show 's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .jason nesmith( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .dane , who played a spock - like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character 's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar 's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die - hard fans .one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers .they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film 's only mean - spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .of course , they all think he is out of his mindand once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .taking shots at both the obvious and not - so - obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub 's fred a .k .a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " ,chen 's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , wo n't take it or something ." it 's a hoot , but it does n't stop there :weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier - than - thou attitude are n't far behind .galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it 's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments --it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .by grabthar 's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .
