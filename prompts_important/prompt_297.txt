Review: warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who 's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what 's _really _ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt .  )instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry .  )it 's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulwort

Review: i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie .  using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super - famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . now , before i continue to ferociously attack what 's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . catherine zeta - jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thie

Review: starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .freeway is giving me second thoughts .freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul - mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) .to top that pathetic premise off-- reese goes to visit granny and you 'll never guess who 's waiting under the cover 's in granny 's bed .keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star .sowhat are they doing in this movie ?after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .the answer is quite simple --i do nt want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .note to keifer: you wonder why you are n't a bigger star in hollywood ? because you keep making movies like this .note to reese: you were great in fear , what happened this time ?note to both: do n't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway .bottom line --i 'm still shaking my head .do n't waste your time on this turkey . if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns .reese witherspoon 's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller .do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- butstay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .
