Review: by starring in amy heckerling 's " clueless " two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she was n't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water . her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june 's " batman & robin , " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . now , she 's the star and producer of " excess baggage , " a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill - composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . silverstone 's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in t

Review: it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . small wonder that hollywood 's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual - underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk, the list goes on . there 's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government 's been long worried about the younger people getting " americanised " and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the

Review: razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .official release : halloween reviewed by vince yim` you think you know all about vampires . . .believe me . . .you know f* ck all . 'with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .so , what 's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?with that out of the way , let me say this .this film is bad .this film is really , really bad .yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ?buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ?any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . period .razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , does n't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the ` opium of the peoples ' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .but aside from that , it does n't stray too far away from horror film conventions .that is , unless that is intentional .razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .you ca n't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .you 'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .you 'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .and then , there 's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin - tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you 've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .but in case you really care , she 's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so - called illuminati , and she 's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .almost destined for cult - status , the film 's campy , cheesy overtonesactually work towards the film .while this may not necessarily be the film you 'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .
