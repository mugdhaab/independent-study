Review: no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan 's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe 's novel about young lad francie brady 's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie 's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie 's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them

Review: over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind 's nuclear testing . partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . now it 's 14 years after toho 's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . in emmerich 's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the s

Review: starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960 's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way .now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel .the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film does n't exactly hurt it either .fast forward to the late ' 80 's .steve mcqueen is n't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) .nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role .that is unless you count matt dillon 's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter .the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original .the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets .it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets .the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original 's .unlike the original , they do n't look campy , they just look cheap .one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith .she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars .in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky .seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite .anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans .the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets .and it is n't the friendliest goop on the block either .anyway , it attacks this little town and it 's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it .not really , but that is how it seems .this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original .as i 've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy .in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness .although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon .the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple --they all stunk out loud .although some of the film 's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows .it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible .sadly , it does n't work very well . if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original .( although that is n't so hot either . ) this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities .
