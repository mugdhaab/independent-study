Review: " spawn " features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather - clad machine gun chick , gooey , self - healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man - eating monster . it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year - old boys , it appears to have been made by them . in a classic example of telling and not showing , " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how " men are the ones who create evil on earth . " so much for a message . the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin / operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil 's army to overtake the wor

Review: in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .was it " deep " ?nope .however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .which was true .if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ;mr . lovell gave it** * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be ." ; mr .travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .i admire mr .burton for trying to do more then entertain , butthe result is a mess .nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .alas, these are only hints .there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .
