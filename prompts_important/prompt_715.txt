Review: "if there 's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . " starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy . in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . crows tear out the eyes of cinderella 's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now moderni

Review: what do you get when you rip - off good movies like woody allen 's bananas and martin scorsese 's after hours ?you 'd think you 'd get the best of both films . instead you get woo . falling in somewhere between def jam 's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african - americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight - laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . mayhem follows them . for some unknown reason ( read :contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo 's antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that

Review: contact ( pg )there 's a moment late in robert zemeckis 's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place .we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops .anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear -- the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead .it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment .jodie foster stars as dr .ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals .and i mean life -- after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie 's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth .after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport .from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci - fi hook .the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power .the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right .it would be easy for scripters james v .hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane .in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so -- there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults .the complex role of ellie is an actress 's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo - in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge .she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge .we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far .contact is clearly foster 's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles .matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer - ellie romance , is the film 's weakest subplot ) .john hurt is effectively creepy as s .r .hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine .most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr .david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances .zemeckis comes off of his three - year break in top shape .always known as a director of effects - laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact 's visual effects are quite stunning .the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis 's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick 's yet more wondrously pure . and zemeckis does n't resist the urge to use the always - interesting incorporate - actors - into - existing - film - footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump .effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump .it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it 's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised .the thought - provoking , two - hour - plus contact is a much - welcome change of pace from summer no - brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also is n't entertaining .for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it 's being sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the universe . " and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .
