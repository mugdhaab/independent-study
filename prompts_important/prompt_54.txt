Review: reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlingtonrd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . the guy ca n't seem to write believable dialogue( sample from reindeer games : " rule # 1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi - faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plotsbut he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard ," oh you thought my movie was gon na go here ,f* ck you jack ass , take that twist ,decipher this mother f * cker !"it 's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . and why the hell would anyone

Review: the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola 's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down - to - earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola 's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popula

Review: stephen , please post if appropriate ." mafia ! "- crime is n't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998 on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as " the godfather , " " goodfellas " and " casino " .at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep .but by my account , i think that my laff - o - meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle .i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film ." mafia !" chronicles vincenzo cortino 's ( lloyd bridges ) life . separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life .but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord .following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) .like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women ." mafia !" is co - written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut - busting funny spoofs such as " airplane " and " the naked gun ."but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .it 's a tough genre to parody .i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say " please " as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly we d daughter - in - law .a gunman shoots him several times .the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .
