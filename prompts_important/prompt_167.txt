Review: so , it 's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . that might have been an exciting notion if it was n't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993 's " grumpy old men , " 1995 's " grumpier old men , " and 1997 's " out to sea" ( i . e . "grumpiest old men " ) . so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e . "the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series . the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau 's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . oscar 's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix 's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .  .  . then hilarity ensues . well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . neil simon , the award - winning playwright who creat

Review: roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . but benigni 's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni 's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost - forgotten harry langdon , benigni 's guido has a childlike innocence . he ignores the growing anti - semitism of the fascist government . instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . in

Review: wong kar - wei 's " fallen angels " is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i 've seen in a long while .unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for .ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of " fallen angels " , this is not so .every shot in this film is excitingjust to * look* at .wongdoes really interesting things with the camera , but he does n't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal " knock off " ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . ugh . )the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives .i ca n't say much more than that as i did n't really know what was going on most of the time .in fact , it was n't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character .the constantly moving camera does n't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character .we 're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters ." fallen angels " isa refreshing change - of - pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level .in fact , i 'd go so far as to say that " fallen angels " is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i 've ever seen .sure , there 's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images istruly something worth celebrating .but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images .there were far too many instances during " fallen angels " in which i asked myself , " now who are these people again ?is this that first couple or the second couple ?"it was impossible to keep track .perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with " name cards " , as in scorsese 's " mean streets " .that 's really besides the point , though .wong kar - wei has proven himself , through very few films , that 'she 's a movie - maker to watch .let 's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .
