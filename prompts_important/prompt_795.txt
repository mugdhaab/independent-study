" the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non - stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in " rush hour " that played well to audiences around the world . the formula worked so well, in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . i 'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow - up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . surprisingly , " rush hour 2 " wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the st

Review: when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! 'i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead .what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script .this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ?four weddings and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between .hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings ' .he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck .unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , butfortunately it works well for him in this movie .if only he would dither a little less .julia knows this role well .the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love .there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness .how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with .the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels .how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment .how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice .
