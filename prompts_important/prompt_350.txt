Review: capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . the first few minutes of sweet sweetback 's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked --that 's the correct number of ss )are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother - surrogate figures . then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that 's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we 're not used to seeing on screen . this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audienc

Review: do n't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson 's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997 's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l - u - v, that 's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close - cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .jovovich , besson 's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they 've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel - level babe ) .and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan 's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .besson 's big mistake, i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue - eyed christ figure on display in besson 's hallucinatory dream sequences .the whole conceit turns into a disasterright about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as " the conscience " ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .that 's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she 's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killingshe 's overseen and joanstarts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who 's about to take a fall .as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .trouble is , he 's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it 's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent ,nothing more than a put - on .this glib , pre - fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer 's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan 's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .--------------------------------------------------------------directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france / usa , 1999 theatrical aspect ratio :2 .35: 1 --------------------------------------------------------------
