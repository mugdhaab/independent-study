Review: it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today 's movies or novels , you must ' suspend disbelief .  'however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald 's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . even if you can ignore these somewhat ' white ' lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain 's plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just do n't gel . firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . he _ should _ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms hunti

Review: this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son 's future in - laws . the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible . williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . williams is excellent as should be no surprise . gene hackman as right - wing potential father - in - law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . the real star is lane . his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight - shooting uncle is hilarious . perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves andthe first few minutes of this film are filled with it . luckily( fo

Review: according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors " hope to restore good old - fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness ." hmm .you never know , they just might be on to something .what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever - contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own .but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it .it 's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch .that 's a shame , because , in the first ten minutesor so the film promises to be a lot more .woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson .the movie opens in the fifties with roy 's dad dishing out the reader 's digest / gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever .the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken .it 's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good- he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy .mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy 's hand .then it 's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand .he 's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) ,an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege .so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way .with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that 's . . .dumb and dumber .yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle .so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen .get set for stock fish - out - of - water situations when city - boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour - socking .now , do n't get me wrong , there 's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy .the trouble is that these jokes are n't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction .it lurches from sports movie to amish - mocking to road - trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together .some gags fall flat from a lack of build - up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply do n't do anything .why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ?why two of these ?why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ?the film is full of these half - thought - through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , " would n't that be funny ? " .well , no , actually .the actors do n't do the movie much favours either .woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer - creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . .please ) .even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie 's climax .all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no - hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance .we 'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( " strictly bowling " , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy .the flying inkpot 's rating system :* wait for the video .** a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !** * pretty good , bring a friend .*** * amazing , potent stuff .**** * perfection . see it twice .
