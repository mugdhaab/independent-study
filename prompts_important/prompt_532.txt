Review: the spy game is up . you can thank charlie 's angels -- the movie -- for that . when did banality and pandering become okay ?just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that 's a movie ?charlie 's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i 've seen in ages . charlie 's angels is dumb . just plain dumb . as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super - agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie . they all drive fast cars , look oh - so - fabulous even in the morning , and do n't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow - motion .  and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage - busting wetsuits , cleavage - busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage - busting w

Review: it 's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director 's cut of the film . films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker 's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classicas a director 's cut . for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors ' cuts -

Review: how could a g - rated disney film based on meg cabot 's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ?easy .take all the cute , harmless fun out of it .and while you 're at it make it borrr - ring .that 's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g - rated disney film " the princess diaries ."you could n't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass .of growing , glowing pre - pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy - duddy old me ) .well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious .too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall 's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride" --but this one 's way without julia robertsso maybe*that 's * its problem ) .in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it( it 's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we have n't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) .marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he 's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two is n't working . . .and hardly* any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there 's none of that here either ) .newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way* not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all minisculeeuropean countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones / tiara combo in the print ads ) .julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia 's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia 's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ?not really .consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets .also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky - looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic / musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia 's chauffeur - driven limousine at every intersection .a non - animated g - rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product .lame , labored , and lamentable, " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight - and - a - half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) .
