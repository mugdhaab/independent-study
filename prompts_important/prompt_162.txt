Review: coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels .  relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , does n't want to deal with similar line of work . divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz 's old cases . to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . fans of the british tv films and mini - series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . they both feature vicious psychopathic killers

Review: since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . now , instead of emphasizing feel - good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993 's schindler 's list shows . most of today 's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . that 's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950 's company town of coalwood , west virginia . it 's a well - known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . the mine , which is run by homer 's father ( chris cooper )

Review: toward the bottom of the ' 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .this carl " apollo creed" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs .evil establishment crook , and relies on all the ' 80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , " you tore his arm off !" jackson replies , " he had a spare ."jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take ityou 're not one of dellaplane 's friends . "" not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .and of course it turns out stone is mrs .dellaplane .faux pas , jackson . ..not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .it 's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane 's nightclub .after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation ."he responds , " you 're getting one , " and it 's damn clever because he 's sitting down at the time .prince would n't even let out an innuendo that lameand he 's the king of the horndogs .. .or at least the prince .it 's a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they 're given , there 's not much room for improvement .my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone 's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head ."jackson 's response is , " i think i felt that way once .they called it love ."you 'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !
