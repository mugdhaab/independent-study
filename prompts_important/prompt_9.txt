Review: moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post - salary cap era -- you 've got to know how to allocate your resources . every dollar spent on a free - agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . in the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special - effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot

Review: if you 've been following william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he 's played some rather similar roles over the years .like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .or colonel williamsharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny -- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard - hitting roles .which is why his performance in " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is such a shock , such a delight .in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog - loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner 's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .it borders on offensive but does n't really manage it .and it borders on clich ?d stereotype butdoes n't quite succumb to that definition either .in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal -- but he 's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devitoso how could that be possible ? )moviegoing experience .fichtner 's performance does n't exactly save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommending " what 's the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor 's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film 's rating from no stars to one - and - a - half .thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down -- way , way , down -- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movieso dull and pedestrian and nonsensicalit does n't even warrant discussion .
