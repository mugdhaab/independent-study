Review: supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 . john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails . a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins . this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery . the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin. we only see one side of each character . kilmer is a bridge builder andthat 's all we see him as . these lions kill dozens of his men and he does n't even appear to be too upset about it . and the plot ?it 's jaws , but with lions . again we 're presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should . it appears to kill men because it just likes too . why ?who knows . i guess there would n't be much of a story if it did n

Review: we 're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo 's vision of a william gibson - inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for .front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber - courier " who smuggles data via a " wet - wired " implant .he 's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long - term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . .the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed .he 's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice - t , and dina meyer .( dolph lundgren 's street preacher is in an acting category all its own .: - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places .the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx -- such as miniatures and mattes -- leave a lot to be desired .watch out for those bad blue - screens !we would n't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better .too bad the debut director is n't very strong in this de- partment .his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down .bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . skip it .
