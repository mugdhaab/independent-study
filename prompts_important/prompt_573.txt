Review: according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god - forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local e

Review: here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy " bait " starring jamie foxx and david morse . this is a review i do n't even want to write because i 'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so - generic - and - predictable - it's - beyond - ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff. if they 're not going to give us , the audience , just a little credit and put something together with half a brain , why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it ?last summer i took this same approach with my review of " the mummy , " in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub - par movies . i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes ( not all are applicable ) . i hope this goes to show you what i think of " bait " and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess . it 's genuinely unfunny( i , and the other audience members only laughed once duri

Review: seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater # 3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .[ theater rating :*** : good seats , sound , and picture ] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it 's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .phillip 's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer 's disease - is n't this rather lowbrow comedy ?he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids ' movie if i ever saw one ) .we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he 's forgotten .sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she 'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it 's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip 's ideas , but his woman too .what 's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .it 's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip 's absent - mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .but it 's clear how weak this premise is from the get - go and the film just gets worse .all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast - moving , flubber - powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that do n't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .it 's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there 's no rules about jumping too high . "" predictable " does n't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .and it 's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it 's the way it 's broken down scene - by - scene , with absolutely no transition .not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .i 'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , soit 's almost forgivable when you realize they 're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .it 's safe to say everything that could be bad about" flubber " is .the only original element the film has is the world 's first romance between a machine and a human .but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you wo n't .
