Review: andrew lloyd webber 's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . "they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he did n't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ?n ,eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( alt

Review: you do n't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy" species ii " is . with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow - up is n't the only reasonit 's so miserable . it 's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . that should have been the end of the movie right there . back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you 'll reme

Review: brian de palma 's snake eyes stars nicolas cage 's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by - the - numbers thriller .ryuichi sakamoto 's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .( the script by de palma and lost world 's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .only the latter is achieved . )cage plays rick santoro ,a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who does n't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog, he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ?that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .the movie 's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .the film takes itself all too seriously .at best , it is a 1940s - style b movie .a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .
