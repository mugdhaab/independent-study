Review: disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan (ming - na wen , singing :lea salonga )wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . .  . it 's just that she does n't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns , led by shan - yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan 's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon - tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . mulan , on

Review: the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury 's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . as always , jacobi 's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style " chance brushstrokes . " starting with a burglary of francis 's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . the camera shots are heavy on the avant - garde angles -- lots of wide - angle close - ups and distorted shots filmed through colored - glass reflections . the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile exam
Important Phrases: ['the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque', 'uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie', 'in a lifeless performance', 'has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly']

Review: i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars .from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet 's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning .from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet 's script was actually a masterpiece .the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer 's complete attention .miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film .also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by deliveringa surprising and memorable ending.mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games .like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film .mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end .the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious .the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued .after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening .his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is whobut it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them .the story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative " process " that everyone is trying to get their hands on .soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his " process ." through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross ' boss mr .klein .played by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role .the most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott 's joe ross .the character 's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable .david mamet 's script is so interesting because we know people do n't actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them .his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge .this is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie .
