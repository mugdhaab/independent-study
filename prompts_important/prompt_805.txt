Review: in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . the cop in question can not solve the case until he gets in trouble . all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . the duo must always be completely mismatched . the hero has to say some smart - assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . however , that does n't necessarily make for a bad film . rush hour is jackie chan 's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . still , some die - hardjackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . jackie chan i

Review: in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . sir anthony hopkins , playing a super - rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . whichever one you like , dear , he says . and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . i liked that scene for two reasons . first , the cakes looked really cool . second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to a

Review: in my review of there 's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter is n't everything ."i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter is n't everything , unless i 'm watching a jim abrahams film .see , spoofs are easy with me .i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .sometimes i 'm the only one in the theater laughing .sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high - pitched in comparison to my speaking voice( it cuts right through everyone else 's laughter ) .sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .abraham 's latest film , mafia !, induced this kind of hysteria upon me .it 's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i 'm the guy who laughs at everything .there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought - provoking .most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .mafia !has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . to describe the story of mafia ! is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !to his experience .he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .he looks like he 's having so much fun that he 's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .he 's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando 's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead - on in a full - blown mockery of sharon stone .the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i 'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! that i ca n't remember a lot of what made me laugh .but that 's a good sign : mafia !is so funny that i was n't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain.i know that does n't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .finally , a film that does this for me .
