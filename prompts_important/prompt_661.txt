Review: one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film . his american buffalo is a set - bound piece that has very little plot . sometimes he will tell a story that really moves . heist is mametdoing his most entertaining work . unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility . heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games . it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double - cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double - crossing the viewer . watching the film 's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either " what the heck are they doing ?"or " why did n't anybody think of that before ? " appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job . it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films . this is a robbery that works li

Review: august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children 's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios do n't want to see slaughtered against family - oriented thanksgiving films . last year , the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon , and this year , they bestow max keeble 's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country . parents will be thrilled because they 'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that does n't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did . do n't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a " ment " away from being a fetish film , is n't that entertaining . in fact , you 'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc .  , harry potter ) come out next month . but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy, then you 'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just is n't going to cu

Review: 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .i 'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i 'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i 've already wasted . while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short.this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels .while the story is n't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better, 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .james spader 's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron( in her first role ) .you know a movie is n't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .even if they are both gorgeous .i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment .not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .or at least not all of it anyway .
