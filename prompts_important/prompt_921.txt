Review: deep rising is one of " those " movies . the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god .  .  . screw that , it says boldly , let 's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . heh !them wacky monsters , got ta love 'em . of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra " oumph " to get people in theaters . that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing. confused ? let me explain : despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good ' ol b movie . luckily , it 's a very good b movie . the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie 's bread and butter . therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us ha

Review: the word to describe sharon stone is " wonder " . not that she _ is _ a wonder , but rather thati wonder how she can be so inconsistent . she has a dynamic screen presence in " basic instinct " , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in " casino " , but possesses neither of those here . stone teams up with private school headmaster 's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani 's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . in a comedy of errors and unexpected twistsstraight out of hitchcock ( as in ` homage to ' [ read " steal from " ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he 's not dead or maybe .  .  . kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . it 's stone that is a disappointment among the actors . how can she be the epitome of a femme

Review: pitch black is a sheep in wolf 's clothing .it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience .do n't be fooled .pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare - fest .it starts off with blistering intensity .a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns .among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship 's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely .there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film .there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal .and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle - bound convicted murderer who 's being brought back to justice by johns .the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other .confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment .those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet 's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh .fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet 's surface .unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters .the group 's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory .or does it ?pitch black deviates from the standard sci - fi fare by avoiding some of the stock " escape the boogieman " conflicts the genre typically serves up .just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false .the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth .a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations .i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist .conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah .one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed .imam is forced to reassess his faith .another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate .yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group .it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick .special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence .his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick .they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger - like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel 's mouth .the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked .the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien .the dialogue is n't the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book .yes , the appearance of riddick 's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation .these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell .twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .
