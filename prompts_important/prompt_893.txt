Review: " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer ' 97 .  for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood 's traditional dumping ground : january . now that it 's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it 's a simple yet highly entertaining film . michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who 's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . the film definately has it 's flaws . the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . also , after keaton 's escape , garcia 's captain barks at him " how many m

Review: here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong - recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . these kinds of movies are marked by an eye - opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life - and - death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass - wearing henchmen . that is not to say that i do n't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers have n't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip - hop - talking thugs and stupid sight gags .  observe the opening sequence . a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . he is undecided . this happen

Review: all those who were offended by there 'ssomething about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch .and while this uproariously funny , gross - out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end .american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage - targeted fare this season .i must question the studio that releases a movie like this .the producers are aiming these films at the 15 - 24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r - rated film .some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie .american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r .but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park .it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny .american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night .jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead .jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : ` like warm apple pie . . . '.of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner .there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game - plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief .american pie is a hard - fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it .i loved the young cast in this movie .consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances .biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise .but in a teen - dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television 's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim 's uneasy father .scenes in which the familiar father - son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .after levy discovers jim 's new use for apple pie , he tells him , ` i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age .but i never used baked goods . 'it is performances such as his , and bill murray 's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out .there are some less - than - original aspects of the film .a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex - lax is something we 've seen before .if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother 's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect .secondly , the characters are forced into a half - hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing .but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart ofit 's own , biggs asks his buddies why he 's going through so much pressure for something that 's ` not very important anyway . 'and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .in it 's own way .
