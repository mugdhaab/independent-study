Review: there is a rule when it comes to movies . a sequel is never as good as the original . there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this is n't even the first sequel to it ,you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . do n't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talentsmatthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) . they made this movie before they were stars . judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons . it 's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey . apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger . apparently the tw

Review: like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly - acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed - out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . a

Review: 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .i 'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i 'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i 've already wasted . while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short.this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels .while the story is n't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better, 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .james spader 's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron( in her first role ) .you know a movie is n't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .even if they are both gorgeous .i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment .not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .or at least not all of it anyway .
