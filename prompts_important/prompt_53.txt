Review: one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i 've given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey 's gone and become a jaded critic on us . just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n ' roll movie like this ?"i 'm wondering the same thing . i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . "it 's the sort of movie i wish i could 've had a lot of fun with , but i did n't . i just did n't . surely this film is n't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar - caliber film ?no ,but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development .  anything . the movie never delivers . you 've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 mi

Review: earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . shanta has a small circle of male admirers . two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . the others -- sikh , hindu , muslim -- are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .

Review: it 's a shamethe execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there 's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .not that there 's anything wrong with scatology .i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .it 's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .adults ?well , let 's just say most will find it unappetizing.osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .frank 's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .it 's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate 's mouth .like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier 's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?s of that genre .and this is why osmosis jones does n't click .it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .the jokes and puns are lame: osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he does n't look fluish ."and the jokes do n't rise above that level .the live action scenes are no better .frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .he 's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat .it lacks scope and depth .it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
