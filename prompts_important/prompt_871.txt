Review: there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor 's effort . often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with " the hurricane . "this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin " hurricane " carter would normally be called " norman jewison 's ' the hurricane , ' " as per the tradition of referring to a film " belonging " to a director . but though he does decent work , jewison can not claim ownership of " the hurricane , " because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late - night shooting in a bar . jail

Review: ` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles .as the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips .he pines for his ex - girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him .this film features good performances , impressive film - making technique and breath - taking crowd scenes .director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie .the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama .not that ambitious film - making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously .the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .
