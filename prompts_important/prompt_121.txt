Review: i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . then marc lawrencedid something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place: he showed me a comic love story about grown - ups . it certainly did n't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom - to - be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his " last night of freedom . " ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom - and - gloom pronouncemen

Review: plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school 's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide . critique : despite this film 's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott 's worst acting performances . add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this " black comedy " ( if you 're gon na create a black comedy , do n't chicken out in the end - see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you 've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter . i barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity to

Review: an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well - worn material .the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop-- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .the reason ?mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .or if our passports were n't missing .
