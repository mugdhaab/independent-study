Review: call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co - star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word / jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . when a

Review: forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken - bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ?surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller 's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above sc

Review: stephen , please post if appropriate ." mafia ! "- crime is n't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998 on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as " the godfather , " " goodfellas " and " casino " .at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep .but by my account , i think that my laff - o - meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle .i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film ." mafia !" chronicles vincenzo cortino 's ( lloyd bridges ) life . separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life .but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord .following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) .like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women ." mafia !" is co - written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut - busting funny spoofs such as " airplane " and " the naked gun ."but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .it 's a tough genre to parody .i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say " please " as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly we d daughter - in - law .a gunman shoots him several times .the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .
