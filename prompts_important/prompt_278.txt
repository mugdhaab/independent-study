Review: if snake eyes were a dog , you 'd put it to sleep . if it was a couch , you 'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . if it were your child , you 'd be reading military school catalogs . if it were a ship -- no , it would n't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . ( personal side note: i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . for whatever reason , my hotel 's cable system was n't showing the astros - braves game , which featured a randy johnson - greg maddux matchup . this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective .  )snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where 's the manager

Review: one of the last entries in the long - running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a ' caravan ' site . professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance ,when anna is asking for ' scrubbers for dirty caravan ' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !arthur upmore( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . mother - in - law jokes prevail . furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyh
Important Phrases: ['the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing', 'work well together', 'a welcome addition to the cast', 'stands out', 'there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors', 'this movie deserves a lot more recognition']

Review: " idle hands " is distasteful , crass and derivative .if an original thought found its way into this horror - comedy it would die of loneliness .plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen - agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo .the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen - agers .the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high - school slacker who 's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed .along the way the hand kills anton 's parents and his two best friends .the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them .that is the level of this 's atrocity 's humor .the movie treats death as a joke ." idle hands " is gruesome and morbid .the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen .it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today 's young people and their values in a satiric vein .however , it 's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people .with the real horrors of the world put before us on television ,a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths ." idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .the time is not right for this type of movie .and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right .this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .
