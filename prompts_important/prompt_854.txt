Review: " mandingo " has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much - needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , " a trashy potboiler " that " appeals only to the s&m crowd . "actually , i think " mandingo " is a strange combination of the two , althoughit fails on both fronts . it 's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him .

Review: it 's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . that 's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so - bright cops ( captions early in the pro

Review: upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .i 'm twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters .director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavilydo we sense any trouble .in the quiet after the music we muse that it 's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate 's hold of the family is n't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .note : this is the first movie review i 've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .: )
