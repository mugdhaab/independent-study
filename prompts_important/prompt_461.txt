Review: well , i 'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante 's peak ) i could just smell what ' twister ' had started . so now it seems that we 're in a full fledged return to the ' 70 's disaster film era . with ' twister ' , ' dante 's peak ' , ' volcano ' and soon ' flood ' and james cameron 's extremly expensive ' titanic ' i 'll say first offi enjoyed ' volcano ' much more than i did ' dantes peak ' . part of that is just being biased asi usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . i 've been reading a lot about the movie being ' cheezy ' or ' hokey ' and really did n't see or think that once during the entire film . i get bored easily and this film did n't bore me for a minute . another thing , and boy am i bitching today !, that bothers me is when critics and such go on about" well that s not really possible . "you know what ?i could n't give a bloody damn if it 's possible or not , really i could n't . it 's a freaking movie and i do n't

Review: according to popular film opinion , a film 's greatness is determined by time . take for example " casablanca . " great film , even today . it 's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . another example would be " star wars , " which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it was n't as cool as when i had first seen it . i had liked it when i saw it the first time (** * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good " escape film . "but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . thus , the curse of the " event film .  " " independence day " is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) . but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait
Important Phrases: ['i felt cheated', 'the aliens are about as anticlimactic', "it 's not handled greatly", 'this film has no balls']

Review: making your first feature film ai n't easy .assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer / director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you 're already ahead of the game . but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ?s , and a well - intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it .again .five irish kids in nyc 's hell 's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .with teary music . and slow motion .in the film 's first scene .the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good - hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .i 'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort ofblah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .he 's concerned about buddy jason gedrick 's heroin abuse .he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin 's character 's sister .he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic - looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .but none of this ever really amounts to anything .it seems that moresco 's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone 's been trying to evoke since scorsese 's early work .so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other .( do people actually do this ! ? )we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f - word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you 've seen in movies just like this one before .assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin 's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy personaso thoroughly that it 's almost funny .moresco ,a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . as a result , the movie 's style is heavy - handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down .nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we do n't comprehend the link to the past .moresco needs to either trust his audience 's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety .if he actually gets that chance .reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) .
