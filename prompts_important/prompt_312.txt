Review: senseless( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . alas , moments are simplythat , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy / comedy above its one - joke premise .  granted , that one joke is initially amusing . when wayans 's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him -- yes -- senseless . this sets up some showcase moments for wayans 's gift for physical

Review: with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ?based on the book by author james ellroy ,l .  a .  confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through .  set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . there is also the young hot - shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all - out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the

Review: what a contrast !in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly .i 'm not sure you could get two more different movies .while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it .this is one interesting movie .it 's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of ' 98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty .there 's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .hurlyburlydoens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .his big question is : does it all pertain to him ?and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ?"it " means everything : television , friends , events that happen .i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what 's it all about ?this is not a movie for answers .donna ( anna paquin ) gives somebut they 're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .that 's what makes this movie stay on your mind .these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time .even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do .the performances are all superb in hurlyburly .i have n't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i ca n't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this .eddie is n't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable .i do n't want to be his friendbut i 'd like to help him .chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person .i 'd never want to know philbut still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real .it 's a nasty world ; it 's a sexist world .unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man 's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men .i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing .first , it 's depressing that such a world exists .a large part of hurlyburly 's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background .second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men 's world .where are the stories about women 's world ? not the soap operas and the " chick flicks " that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men .hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .it 's very talkative , intelligent and static .while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they 're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience .all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .it also means that you have to pay attention .
