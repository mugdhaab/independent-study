Review: known as the most successful , highest - grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with " pretty woman , " which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word - of - mouth , was able to reach upwards of $ 175-million in theaters alone . the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film 's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . the other winning element that makes " pretty woman" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today 's films as it is here . edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend 's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . stopping the car along the street ,

Review: the small - scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . filled with breathtaking scenery , ' characters ' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot .the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny .what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds .the village consists of several amusing characters .a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch .there 's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up - and - up .there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .pacing is right .towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that 's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we 've been interested in the goings on .a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment- all the right emotions are engaged .in one brief dream sequence - you 'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .one of the key moments in the film .the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939 - 2 ) follows the same arc as the movie andis well worth considering . a fine film that 's for everybody except action fans .somewhat like ' the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . .but livelier .
