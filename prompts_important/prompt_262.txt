Review: about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out" i hope she gets killed now !"at that point it hit me :i did n't care for any of the characters being played by actors i did n't really like . when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he 's being played by sidney poitier , you knowsomething 's rotten in the state of denmark . every year , a couple films like this are released . you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi - promising premise , some big - name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . this was the third one of ' 97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the s

Review: no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again -see: i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society 's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , butwhat 's remarkable is how timeless this film is . the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - was n't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it 'd be kinda different ( a given ) . it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim - witted young man with big dreams . in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson (

Review: in our time .in our modern world , where the cool rule , it 's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming ' the man ' .and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic .in warner brothers ' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away .though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare 's ' romeo and juliet ' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare 's poetry .the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese .the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered .the afro - americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers .it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother 's death .escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother 's fate .but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty .the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . .there 's only a weak echo of shakespeare 's talent in this disappointing production .and there are more problems besides its title.of course we do n't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece .we call it ' modernization ' .it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights .this lack of respect for the audience i findvery disturbing.kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare does n't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature .and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare .i must admit that i found ' rome must die ' very confusing .i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing .he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision .unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments .his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow .the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified .jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice .their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act .they are nothing more than two celebrities put together .the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances .delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality .but there 's more than acting to worry about .even with li 's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing.to make a long story short : ' romeo must die ' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film .it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to ' romeo and juliet ' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be .and in the end it 's nothing .there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises .so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement .this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences .the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre .it is mostly provided by aalyah 's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of ' ghetto feel ' to it .but when i think back , it 's not muchi remember from this ' production ' .as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects .it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it does n't have any .for someone who has never read shakespeare , it 's another popcorn film .for those of us who has , it 's a waste of money , time and brain cells .
