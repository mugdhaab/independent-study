Review: notting hill 's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . the movie was desperately marketed to the anti - phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . and it apparently worked . perhaps the presence of julia roberts - whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me - had a lot to do with notting hill 's opening weekend success , but the film 's staying power is based on word of mouth .  allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . grant stars as william thacker , a travel - bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . a common thief , some spilled orange juice , andsome stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptit

Review: the 13th warrior reeks so badly ofmelodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine 's least appetizing residue. the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . my vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man 's wife . he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men . fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who 's acting seems closer to that of his role 
Important Phrases: ['awful experience', 'so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter', 'a new low point', 'unfortunately', 'the dialogue seem completely phony', 'the plot is incredibly difficult to follow', 'unfortunately']
