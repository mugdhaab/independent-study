Review: this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend .  .  . ned kelly , the so - called robin hood of the aussies . but he fails to be convincing, in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . the film opens to a b / w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution . then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family . this scene is set in 1871 . in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein 's lyrics , which tells -- of ned 's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic . ned says a debt must be paid .  .  .  as he hears voices from his dead father , his class - divided country , and his consci

Review: there 's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably should n't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . " lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it 's such a blatant rip - off of " fargo " andevery movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yetit somehow still works for me . i know i 'm in the minority here but let me explain . the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . john travolta plays the local big - shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . she 's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desirebut somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl -not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . crystal 's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager .
Important Phrases: ['it somehow still works for me', 'is just funny', "it 's funny and i can respect that", 'great in his role', 'perfect in this role', 'i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled', 'does a fine job in balancing the characters', "i liked it , and i could see it again - is n't that what makes a movie good ?"]

Review: the small - scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . filled with breathtaking scenery , ' characters ' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot .the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny .what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds .the village consists of several amusing characters .a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch .there 's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up - and - up .there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .pacing is right .towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that 's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we 've been interested in the goings on .a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment- all the right emotions are engaged .in one brief dream sequence - you 'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .one of the key moments in the film .the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939 - 2 ) follows the same arc as the movie andis well worth considering . a fine film that 's for everybody except action fans .somewhat like ' the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . .but livelier .
