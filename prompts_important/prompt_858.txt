Review: " ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . this picture does n't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ?and why is it told like a 91-minute sit - com instead of a feature film ?rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . he obviously does n't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company 's girls ' soccer team . what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . i did n't laugh , but for some reason it did n't annoy me that much . chester 's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off t

Review: that thing you do !, from first - time film director tom hanks , is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band , the wonders , that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country . but , the question arrises , will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one - hit wonder , or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ?the " oneders " , as they are originally known , have their first gig at a very small - time contest . jimmy , the lead singer , has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest . but , a short time before the contest begins , the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed . enter guy patterson , skilled musician who currently works at his father 's appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him . he seems to fit in well , until the group takes the stage . when they begin to play , guy 's beat

Review: upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .i 'm twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters .director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavilydo we sense any trouble .in the quiet after the music we muse that it 's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate 's hold of the family is n't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .note : this is the first movie review i 've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .: )
