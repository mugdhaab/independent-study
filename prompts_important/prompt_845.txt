Review: " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film . in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who has n't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . but i managed to catch it before it made it 's way out of theaters and into the world of rentalsand , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . it was n't the worst film of year by any means . it is n't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list . the only reason it does n't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year . performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy . in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . i do n't know how to explain that one ; it was n't exactly choppy 
Important Phrases: ['it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list', 'were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy', 'annoyingly unprofessional', 'it was just plain boring', 'the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way', 'melodramatic voice - over and lobotomizing editing', 'has very little to offer', 'there are many better ones out there']

Review: an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well - worn material .the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop-- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .the reason ?mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .or if our passports were n't missing .
