Review: the happy bastard 's quick movie review damnthat y2k bug . it 's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . little do they know the power within .  .  . going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virusstill feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . we do n't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we do n't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we do n't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . here , it 's just" hey , let 's chase these people around with some robots " . the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . you 're more likely to get a kick out of her work in

Review: every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody 's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . mtv films ' _ election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?the plot is deceptively simple . george washington carver high school is having student elections . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over - achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . mr . " m " ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular - but - slow jock to run . and paul 's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than t

Review: according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers .at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german-american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) .hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) .their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock 's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot .instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband .eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere .the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale .in the end , this film reminds us that original approach ca n't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer 's girlfriend . )
