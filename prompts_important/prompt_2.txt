Review: you 've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it 's body ( it 's basically a complete re - shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . it 's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan / hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . it could n't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . i have n't quite yet figured out w

Review: it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . based on the late 1960 's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . of course , the ads make it seem like so much more . quick cuts , cool music , claire dane 's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like .  sounds like a cool movie ,does it not ?after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply is n't enough . the film is best described as a cross between an hour - long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half .  andwith it comes every single clich ?. it does n't reall
Important Phrases: it quickly becomes apparent that it is not, that simply is n't enough, with it comes every single clich ?, the characters and acting is nothing spectacular, bordering on wooden, as if they are bored, all the characters do n't do much apart from occupying screen time, even he 's not enough to save this convoluted mess, the film is way too juvenile, the plot is extremely predictable, dialogue is poorly written, nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar, avoid this film at all costs

Review: if you 've been following william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he 's played some rather similar roles over the years .like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .or colonel williamsharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny -- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard - hitting roles .which is why his performance in " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is such a shock , such a delight .in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog - loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner 's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .it borders on offensive but does n't really manage it .and it borders on clich ?d stereotype butdoes n't quite succumb to that definition either .in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal -- but he 's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devitoso how could that be possible ? )moviegoing experience .fichtner 's performance does n't exactly save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommending " what 's the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor 's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film 's rating from no stars to one - and - a - half .thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down -- way , way , down -- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movieso dull and pedestrian and nonsensicalit does n't even warrant discussion .
