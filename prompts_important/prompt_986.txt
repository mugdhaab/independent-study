Review: to sum the entire film " 54 " up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . " 54 " , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk ,told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio " 54 " . phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co - owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender .  .  . you expected more , did n't you . there is n't . the film builds up from nothing and bec

Review: one of kyle mclachlan 's earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . plot : a science - fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an " entity " from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this " thing " before it 's too late . critique :this fast - paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra - violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock ' n roll attitude . then again , how can you go wrong with an " alien " that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? !granted , the plot is n't the most elaborate of tales 
Important Phrases: ['this fast - paced', 'i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture', 'have a blast ! !', "one of the most rockin ' scenes to open any action movie", 'another eye - catcher']

Review: let 's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale .with no new eye - candy for four weeksstraight , we 've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi - nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers .sigh .thank god for desperado .the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi -- director robert rodriguez 's notorious $ 7000 debut -- stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name .he 's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case .( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . )so , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex - mex version of the punisher , if you will .there is n't much of an emotional core to desperado .rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo .( and sergio leone . . . and sam peckinpah . . . )some may wince at the body count -- at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate -- but it 's all played for laughs .big , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films .sick , slick fun .
