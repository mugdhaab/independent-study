Review: ladies and gentlemen , 1997 's independence day is here !it 's title : starship troopers . and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . i realize that i gave last year 'ssci - fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really was n't as great as it seemed -- though i still give it a positive review . starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick - ass space opera which reinvented the sci - fi drama altogether . while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the ' star wars ' of the 90s . " am i be

Review: the cartoon is way better . that 's the bottom line on disney 's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic " home alone " with puppies , and not much else . when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be " why ?the original cartoon still works , so what 's the point ?"the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign . the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple . two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight . they drag their " human pets " together , and in a short time both couples marry . the heavenly match - ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy 's new - born pups are stolen ; their dog - napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts . everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies . in

Review: an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well - worn material .the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop-- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .the reason ?mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .or if our passports were n't missing .
