Review: the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as ' anywhere but here .  ' there is n't one thing about this mother - daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughterwhat was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they could n't figure it out for themselves . if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . alvin sargent 's script was weak and annoyingly claustral. wayne wang 's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action could n't convey . pushy mother ade

Review: gothic murder - mystery yarns are not a new conceit . in fact , they 've been around in books and on film for many , many years . without the proper handling , they come off as old - fashioned , bland , and outdated . "the gift , " directed by sam raimi , is a tried - and - true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . it 's fairly obvious who the killer is ;in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . the film ultimately should n't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other. annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving

Review: thistalky , terribly - plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex - new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light - plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat .he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that 's when the trouble begins .the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) .everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that 's curious but never compelling .based on the book by james lee burke , heaven 's prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing .early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves .nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa .later , dave is reunited with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation .huh ?the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf .whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess .in its present form , heaven 's prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .
