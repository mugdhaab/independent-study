Review: sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . it 's not the time or the distance , it 's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . yet somehow , the movies are all well madeand i always get caught up in the story . the wings of the dove fits the pattern . kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . but kate 's " job " , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . her father lost all of her family 's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . naturally , a newspaper writer 's wages do n't count as " rich . " kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he 's not marriageable . kate 's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . at a party , millie catches a gli

Review: even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf 's tribe . let me start out by saying that krippendorf 's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that 's about its only asset . the best word to describe this film is " asinine . " the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . krippendorf 's tribe tries to be a zany , off - the - wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important ru

Review: while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him . as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take - off .when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake .the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted .he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die .alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious " suicide " of a friend , and a mortician ( tony " candyman " todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death 's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims .in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death 's new plan and thwart it .of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the " scream " audience , " final destination " is the best so far .talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variationon a familiar formula .we 've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one - by - one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey - masked middle - man and makes the villain death itself .first - time feature director james wong made the most of that premise .every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime .everyday objects and events vibrate with menace .the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver 's " rocky mountain high , " which is played several times in the movie before someone dies .( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . ) the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror .devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , " idle hands , " gives a frantic and convincing lead performance .kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex 's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane .smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence .seann william scott , who 's also in theaters right now in " road trip , " plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter .tony todd 's one - scene cameo is delicious but all too brief .bottom line :watchableteen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting .
