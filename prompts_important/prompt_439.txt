Review: it must be tough to be a mob boss . just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . i can believe it , too - one ca n't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he 's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with .  suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help .  and who better than billy crystal . after appearing in bottom - of - the - barrel flops , father 's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . playing vitti 's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in - joke , i think . placed in this mobster 's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himsel

Review: last summer , a feature - length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . based on the famous 60 's television show , the film was an enormous box - office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . but it sounded promising : the same tag - team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . and co - star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?the answer is just about everything . wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate. there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful

Review: to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .also , a beautifully anti - climactic ending .not to say it did n't look intriguing when i saw the previews .so much for truth in advertising .roland emmerich , who 's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co - writed and directed this inane sci - fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .it would n't be till present day ( ' 94 ) till they would actually figure it out .they 're decipherer ?a slightly - neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr .dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who 's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?so there is a hokey ending !duh !he figures it out in about a minute .yea .and then they get a suicidal colonel or something, " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat - top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .why a suicidal colonel ?for the ending !you 'll get the hang of this .they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .after an overdone special effects thing , they 're . . .inside a goddam pyramid .so they went to egypt ,right ?wrong .they 're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .yea .also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .an anti - climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo - pseudo - pseudo - character development .by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i do n't know , the " outer limits " or something .the script 's terrible .the special effects are okay , but nothing great .the story 's so weak that it 's almost opaque.the whole experience just is n't worth it unless you 're so bored that you 'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . .or this .i 'd pick this , obviously , but still ,it 's just not fun at all .and i ca n't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
