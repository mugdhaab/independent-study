Review: the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could 've been effective . such is the case with _ urban legend _ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up, so you ca n't see the face . i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . it 's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . unfortunately , the film never takes off from there . the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose

Review: " idle hands " is distasteful , crass and derivative .if an original thought found its way into this horror - comedy it would die of loneliness .plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen - agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo .the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen - agers .the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high - school slacker who 's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed .along the way the hand kills anton 's parents and his two best friends .the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them .that is the level of this 's atrocity 's humor .the movie treats death as a joke ." idle hands " is gruesome and morbid .the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen .it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today 's young people and their values in a satiric vein .however , it 's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people .with the real horrors of the world put before us on television ,a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths ." idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .the time is not right for this type of movie .and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right .this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .
