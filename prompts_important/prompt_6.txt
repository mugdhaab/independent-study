Review: " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien - like underwater sounds . then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams ' now infamous score . dah - dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams ' music . he 's buildi

Review: according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers .at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german-american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) .hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) .their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock 's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot .instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband .eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere .the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale .in the end , this film reminds us that original approach ca n't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer 's girlfriend . )
