Review: in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen - style , earnestly shallow gen - x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . does men live up to its press ?well , yes it does . and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of busin

Review: as a hot - shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness 's testimony . and , on top of that , he 's a damn good trial lawyer . in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it does n't hamper lomax 's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full - time position as head of their newly - created criminal law division . lomax is soon given the case of his life . he mu

Review: what would inspire someone who can not write or act to pen and star in a movie ?a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? if you have an answer , let me know .foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw - droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming valuesocially , cinematically or otherwise .comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand - up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for .master p stars as fifty dollah '( beat that ! )as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club / act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert 's " idiot plot ," if everyone here was n't an idiot , there would be no problem ) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?not a hell of a lot .as i have mentioned , master p can not act or write.he acts like the rapper that he is .the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .if you have n't yet figured it out , that is not saying much .co - star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand - up and otherwise .he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , andwhile i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .and indeed , i laughed at a few stand - up scenes here , but from a feature - length movie i expect more .foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry - sporting sibling " you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush " ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion" huh ?" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard - earned $ 8 .you 'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you do n't have cable .eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away . & # 137 ;
