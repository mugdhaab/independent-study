Review: " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who 's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza 's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . sound confusing ?it is . i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . in some respects , it works . but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off - screen . the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding rela

Review: meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 )starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani in " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death . that 's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul - collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it 's like to be human . death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . for one thing , death - as - pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ?besides eternal damnation , of course . there is also a sub - plot about forlani 's ex - boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . " meet joe black " runs just under three hours . i 've always thought that such obscene running times should b

Review: i had an epiphany today .it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill ."it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it 's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .too bad i did n't trust my own instincts when something - or - the - other possessed me to see this movie .i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow ." that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozythat tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .i wish i 'd seen it when it was halloween .at least i would have been forgiving .hey , tis the season .the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously was n't going anywhere .now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .that 's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that 's different from utterly nonsensical .hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .. .well let 's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh - so - cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .riiiiight .y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .yeah .just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .ooooooo .hint : blood and guts only work a few times .sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it 's just ketchup and props and you 've got to come up with something better than that .there were just too many things in this movie that we 've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .each was more predictable than the last .why did n't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?sheesh .was i grossed out ?yes .did i get spooked a few times ?yes .but why ?i get really disturbed when there is no why .when there were n't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which was n't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .the characters were incredibly flat and cliched . not to mention downright annoying .you 've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they 're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .and of course , all three gals are babes .i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .keep that up , geoff , and you 'll qualify for the next batman venture .the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .and famke jansen (sp ? )because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante 's peak " three times for him : ) .all right , i concede .there were a couple of things i enjoyed .that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .i probably wo n't ride a rollercoaster for a while .and the machine they used to drive geoffrey 's character mad ( see , i do n't even remember their names ) .the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .it would n't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .thank god they did n't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .god , there is no hope .
