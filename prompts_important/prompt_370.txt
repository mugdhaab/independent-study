Review: "the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it 's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually , if you 've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . but he 's afflicted with loser - itis . dogs attack him, neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him . truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we 'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . this is actually bad because you ca n't like a character if you ca n't develop sympathy for him . we never do ,

Review: it 's a shamethe execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there 's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .not that there 's anything wrong with scatology .i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .it 's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .adults ?well , let 's just say most will find it unappetizing.osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .frank 's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .it 's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate 's mouth .like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier 's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?s of that genre .and this is why osmosis jones does n't click .it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .the jokes and puns are lame: osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he does n't look fluish ."and the jokes do n't rise above that level .the live action scenes are no better .frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .he 's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat .it lacks scope and depth .it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
