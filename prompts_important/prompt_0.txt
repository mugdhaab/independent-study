Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no id

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems al

Review: there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of " scream queen " in the early ' 80s .two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween .the same " god , i 'm scared, there 's some guy in a mask coming after me " routine she did in john carpenter 's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense .terror train takes place on ( where else ? )a train , charted by some pre - med students finishing their first four years of higher education .most of them wo n't make it to med school , though , and it 's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , " i wish to hell they 'd put a radio on that train ."the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee .from the beginning , he 's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co - workers " think on this -- when 's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? " as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles .of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it .i forgot to mention the prologue .it 's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students .two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he 's going to get laid .they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed .she says , " kiss me , kenny , " and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver .( " oh my god , they killed kenny !you bastards ! ")it 's a sick trick , and one jamie lee was n't let in on .she still has n't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train( " you asshole , you ca n't have a good time without hurting somebody ! " ) .the killing starts before the train even leaves the station .since it 's new year 's , everyone 's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we 've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one 's looking .at least one of the characters says it 's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie .speaking of weird - looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train 's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield " as the magician , " who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music .then there 's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that .for all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching .only die - hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it .and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse .i mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ?terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car .
