Review: capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . i had a good time .  ,low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) here goes my credibility . this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . i liked the third jurassic park film . i even liked the second jurassic park film . in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three - way braiding together of michael crichton 's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle 's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , " for the boy who 's half man or the man who 's half boy .

Review: a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle " heaven can wait " ( which in turn was a remake of " here comes mr . jordan " ) , " down to earth " tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , " lethal weapon iv " ) , a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlem 's apollo theater . when he 's taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy , " best in show " ) , his only recourse is to return in another body . he chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states . of course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance 's bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , " jerry maguire " ) , a tad tricky . the original elaine may / warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k . to turn beatty 's vehicle as a football player into rock 's vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor

Review: in my review of there 's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter is n't everything ."i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter is n't everything , unless i 'm watching a jim abrahams film .see , spoofs are easy with me .i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .sometimes i 'm the only one in the theater laughing .sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high - pitched in comparison to my speaking voice( it cuts right through everyone else 's laughter ) .sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .abraham 's latest film , mafia !, induced this kind of hysteria upon me .it 's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i 'm the guy who laughs at everything .there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought - provoking .most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .mafia !has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . to describe the story of mafia ! is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !to his experience .he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .he looks like he 's having so much fun that he 's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .he 's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando 's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead - on in a full - blown mockery of sharon stone .the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i 'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! that i ca n't remember a lot of what made me laugh .but that 's a good sign : mafia !is so funny that i was n't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain.i know that does n't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .finally , a film that does this for me .
