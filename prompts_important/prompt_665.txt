Review: like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly - acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed - out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . a

Review: there is a rule when it comes to movies . a sequel is never as good as the original . there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this is n't even the first sequel to it ,you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . do n't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talentsmatthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) . they made this movie before they were stars . judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons . it 's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey . apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger . apparently the tw

Review: what would inspire someone who can not write or act to pen and star in a movie ?a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? if you have an answer , let me know .foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw - droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming valuesocially , cinematically or otherwise .comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand - up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for .master p stars as fifty dollah '( beat that ! )as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club / act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert 's " idiot plot ," if everyone here was n't an idiot , there would be no problem ) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?not a hell of a lot .as i have mentioned , master p can not act or write.he acts like the rapper that he is .the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .if you have n't yet figured it out , that is not saying much .co - star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand - up and otherwise .he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , andwhile i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .and indeed , i laughed at a few stand - up scenes here , but from a feature - length movie i expect more .foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry - sporting sibling " you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush " ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion" huh ?" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard - earned $ 8 .you 'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you do n't have cable .eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away . & # 137 ;
