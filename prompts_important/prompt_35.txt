Review: the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that h

Review: so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci - fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ?well , whatever it is , you 'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we 're left with here . this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !it 's like i said .  .  . this movie sucks . plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . uneven, would be another . the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so - so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minute

Review: in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .was it " deep " ?nope .however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .which was true .if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ;mr . lovell gave it** * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be ." ; mr .travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .i admire mr .burton for trying to do more then entertain , butthe result is a mess .nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .alas, these are only hints .there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .
