Review: unfortunately it does n't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . there 's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops are n't immune ? ) . then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un - related plot point . dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they

Review: the disney studios has its formula for annual , full - length animated features down so pat that it 's hard to remember which one you 're watching at any given moment . " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines -- ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan -- get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . add the requisite love interest and a wise - cracking sidekick or two ,pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage - backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . bob 's your uncle !better make that walt 's your uncle .  .  . kids will no doubt go ga - ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie
Important Phrases: kids will no doubt go ga - ga, everything comes together, a memorable , show - stopping musical interlude, spectacular cavalry charge, strongest female character to date

Review: burnt money is the perfect festival film .it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again .this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 's emerging masters series is easily one of the year 's worst.billed as a gay ` bonnie and clyde ' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ?eyro has its only highlight in a well - designed title sequence .two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry .this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . hiding out in a prostitute 's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie 's conclusion .if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love .as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying .or something like that .everything that happens is so quick and confusingi was completely lost .clarity is n't exactly this movie 's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up .not much could have really happened though .the main events in this long two - hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language .lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there 's a reason , but there 's no purpose to anything in this film .most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing .it appears pi ?eyro ( who co - wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement .he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go .burnt money is pointless .the performances are bad .it tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom.god forbid it will ever get a distributor .another disappointing film from this year 's so - called emerging masters series .pass on by .
