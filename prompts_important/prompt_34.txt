Review: so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci - fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ?well , whatever it is , you 'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we 're left with here . this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !it 's like i said .  .  . this movie sucks . plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . uneven, would be another . the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so - so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minute

Review: the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that h

Review: my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) .i did n't see the first film until much later .so looking back , the original did n't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i did n't think too much of it when i initially saw it .watching it now for a second time confirmed that it 's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever.you all know the story by now :child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before .this first installment does an adequate job withit 's low budget , butthere 's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story .plus the movie 's ending( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a " hook " for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless .and does anyone understand what happens to nancy 's mother at the end of this film ?do n't get me wrong though .. .it 's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics .most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is .horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just does n't cut it .a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video .it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set .the film is presented in both pan and scan and it 's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) .the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 .1 mix . also included on the dvd is a full - length audio commentary track with writer / director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film 's director of photography .other extras include the " jump to a nightmare " feature ( i 'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film 's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film 's original theatrical trailer .some dvd - rom features are also included , but since i do n't have dvd - rom capabilities i ca n't really get into that .the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular .the first thing of note is that it 's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago .i 'm not saying that 's a negative thing , just pointing it out .everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just does n't say much at all .most of the time you 'll forget he 's even there .everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they 're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible .the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series .also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . .however you can only access one easily .the other is hidden in what 's called " the labyrinth " , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created .basically , it 's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc .somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film .finding it though is both a chore and a bore .[ r ]
