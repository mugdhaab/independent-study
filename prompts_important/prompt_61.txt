Review: there 's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action - packed , and entertaining of the three films . the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . even darth vader does n't seem very intimidating this time around . with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition - like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayh

Review: i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .i 'm big fan of perry 's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley 's on - edge , extreme acting was a riot .so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley 's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry 's big breakthrough .i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley 's best , in spite of david spade 's absence .i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .sadly , none of this came to pass .the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one - liners few and far between .perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it 's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it 's a farley flick .the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .and farley 's classic humor is widespread , too .almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot .guys , let 's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?stick to " tommy boy " , and we 'll all be " friends " .
