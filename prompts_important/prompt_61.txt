Review: play it to the bone ,the newest addition to ron shelton 's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . like most of shelton 's other great films ( bull durham , white men ca n't jump ), this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . shelton 's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . the film has no social message like its predecessors . the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring

Review: die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film 's pathetic screenplay .every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs .so much for the script .how about the action ?well , let 's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator --all standouts for their hair - raising suspense .by contrast , harlin does n't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so badit 's good .you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .
