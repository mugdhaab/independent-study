Review: mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow . that 's some ape . "joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . he picks things up and stares at them pensively . he breaks things on accident , because he 's just too big to avoid clumsiness . joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .  as a character , he does n't quite register . and the story he 's been put in is as limp as they come . the words " family en

Review: in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .was it " deep " ?nope .however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .which was true .if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ;mr . lovell gave it** * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be ." ; mr .travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .i admire mr .burton for trying to do more then entertain , butthe result is a mess .nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .alas, these are only hints .there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .
