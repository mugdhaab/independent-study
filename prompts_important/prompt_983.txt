Review: barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar , timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks . on the surface , he 's coming home for a high school reunion , but since this is a movie , you know that he 's really looking for some major life decisions . a fairly " small " film , this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman , rosie o'donnell and a bunch of actors that you 've seen before but ca n't quite place . commendable jobs all around; they seem like real people . hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit - dead father , terminally goony brother and old high school chums . all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis . the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst . he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor : a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him . the problem is that she is only 13 . unc

Review: at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong . but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts . that 's " dirty work " in a nutshell . a very different kind of movie . this is not a movie that i can easily review . the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters .  .  .  and tells me this movie is terrible . but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing . this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie . it 's a one note concept . mitch and sam need $ 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients . realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in " happy gilmore " and " veronica 's closet " seems typcast in t

Review: let 's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale .with no new eye - candy for four weeksstraight , we 've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi - nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers .sigh .thank god for desperado .the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi -- director robert rodriguez 's notorious $ 7000 debut -- stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name .he 's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case .( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . )so , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex - mex version of the punisher , if you will .there is n't much of an emotional core to desperado .rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo .( and sergio leone . . . and sam peckinpah . . . )some may wince at the body count -- at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate -- but it 's all played for laughs .big , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films .sick , slick fun .
