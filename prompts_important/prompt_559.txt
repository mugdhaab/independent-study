Review: the main problem with martin lawrence 's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it does n't seem to do anything except justify the woman 's actions . that is especially the case in lawrence 's darnell wright . he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . now do n't think i condone this just because i 'm male . my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . darnell does n't think like this . he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia (

Review: the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany 's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook - yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable andshe is quite resistible .alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we 're fuck buddies . " )but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee 's inability to decide what she wants to be saying .she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .alessa is looking for financial securitybut she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .this appears to be a high profile and well - paid job .we are supposed to care about alessa 's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .alessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double - zero.i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
