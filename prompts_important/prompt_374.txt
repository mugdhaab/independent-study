Review: 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . i , however , would rather cut to the chase . 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . and it 's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they 're in this year 's boogie nights . they are so wrong . the picture has been assembled by mark christopher . based on this film , i do n't know how he got a job in the business. 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . i do n't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was rel

Review: weir is well - respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject - matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post - traumatic stress disorder ) among them . in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now - tired concept of media - manipulation by tackling the material from the inside - out . it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top - form playing the title character , truman burbank . by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24 - 7 peep - show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . ` seahaven ' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing ov

Review: has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot - driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 's lame brained men in black .will this guy ever get a real role ?he has the bruce willis syndrome .the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . .you know .enemy was one of the worst films of last year .not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight ,the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i did n't like how smith always magically out - smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .somehow , quality ca n't overshadow quantity .
