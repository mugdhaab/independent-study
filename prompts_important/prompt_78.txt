Review: " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . strangely enough , on the same mid - january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 's " leviathan , " 1989 's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures . " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well - made and produced , but since it does n't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence ,it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the wate
Important Phrases: cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times, it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on, does n't appear to have a brain in its head, worn - out conventions, it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film, it is far from one of the best, shameless and overdone plot gimmicks

Review: the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .it 's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , butit does n't make a shred of sense .and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor .but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .at least we have chow yun - fat in the lead role .chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop .he 's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he 's very familiar with chinatown .that 's probably why the powers - that - be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .nick and danny begin by stepping on each other 's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one 's life .what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .i 'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .i 'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .i 'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , althoughthis makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .there 's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny 's father ( brian cox ) , but it does n't have much to do with the main story .one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie does n't make any sense .i do n't blame this entirely on foley , because he 's obviously a good director .i 'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci 's script , which does n't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .one scene early on had me particularly annoyed :nick confronts his boss because he 's angry about his new white partner .he 's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . )there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent.there 's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .the plot itself never straightens out .i 'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group .the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .the sequences are n't bad , but they 're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?one too many , i 'd imagine .foley 's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here .the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he 's still fun to watch .i also liked the subplot involving danny 's father ; brian cox 's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes .a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it 's over .the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of controluntil , finally , there 's nothing left to hold on to .
