Review: today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan . steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production . the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war . please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality . tom hanks is stunningas capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war . spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes . private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made . the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women . we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today . for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget . the academy will not

Review: it 's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand - up around but completely fall flat in the movies. take adam sandler . on the basis of his first two cds ( " they 're all gon na laugh at you !"and " what the hell happened to me ? " ) , he 's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . but when you put him in front of a camera , it just is n't the same . i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . seriously , i 'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . the first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it 's scenes of emotional abuse towards adam 's character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . granted , af

Review: making your first feature film ai n't easy .assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer / director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you 're already ahead of the game . but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ?s , and a well - intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it .again .five irish kids in nyc 's hell 's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .with teary music . and slow motion .in the film 's first scene .the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good - hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .i 'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort ofblah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .he 's concerned about buddy jason gedrick 's heroin abuse .he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin 's character 's sister .he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic - looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .but none of this ever really amounts to anything .it seems that moresco 's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone 's been trying to evoke since scorsese 's early work .so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other .( do people actually do this ! ? )we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f - word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you 've seen in movies just like this one before .assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin 's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy personaso thoroughly that it 's almost funny .moresco ,a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . as a result , the movie 's style is heavy - handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down .nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we do n't comprehend the link to the past .moresco needs to either trust his audience 's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety .if he actually gets that chance .reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) .
