Review: claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they 're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame - brained big - screen version of the 70s tv show .the story has all the originality of a block of wood( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver 's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come .by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they 're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate cast .
