Review: tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . however , they wo n't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she 's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on - again , off - again relationship with joe 's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he 's always pursued : a real blonde . there are some mo

Review: jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive - compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you - know - where . he 's mean . i mean really mean . the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . at that point we fi

Review: synopsis : in " sooner than you think " america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs .a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them .comments : so , what do an ex - gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ?why , they 're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks !they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one anothera lathe marines in james cameron 's aliens .yes , it 's blade squad , the fox network 's wednesday night movie of the week .this " movie , " marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars ."how can a movie have guest stars ?"you may ask .well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie .blade squad is dumb .blade squad is loud .blade squad is obnoxious .blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long - lived tv series .why not ?after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( " knight rider " ) , fast helicopters ( " airwolf " ) , and super fast motorcycles ( " street hawk " ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past .so , why not crimefighters with jet - powered roller blades ?to be honest , as a made - for - tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable .the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half - interested .i 'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it .i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad .i can remember liking " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 .and , although this is n't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book 's terrific two - year beginning ) .but , i digress .despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series .one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer 's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background .oh yeah ,dylan 's " knockin ' on heaven 's door " and bowie 's" i 'm afraid of americans " are used here ,in rather poor taste .two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound .the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .characters ' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible .during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . when a character spoke , the song 's volume dropped but did not disappear . as soon as that character finished speaking , the song 's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke .this sounds trivial , i 'm sure , but it distracted me immensely .finally , this is commercial television .foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television .thus , do n't use foul language in a made - for - tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner .in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets .when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car 's horn off - screen to muffle the word out .in a " seinfeld " episode , this technique proved funny ; here ,it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably .perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics ' 2099 series of comics .make up a bunch of new bad words for the future .this way , you do n't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language .compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp .when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .( review written august 12 , 1998 )
