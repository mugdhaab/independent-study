Review: well i 'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex - porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950 's drive - in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci - fi flick of 1995 . once again , b - movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it 's an absolute must - see for sci - fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . the plot in brief . paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . his race is dying of a mysterious blood dis

Review: adam sandler is n't known for appearing in deep , thought - provoking films , but he 's still a really funny guy . most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler 's comic performance , and it 's a miserable failure. sandler plays a thirty - something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . as one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say " good - bye " to one another ; in addition , there 's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . there 's a hilarious running joke featuring a female docto

Review: when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! 'i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead .what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script .this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ?four weddings and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between .hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings ' .he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck .unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , butfortunately it works well for him in this movie .if only he would dither a little less .julia knows this role well .the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love .there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness .how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with .the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels .how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment .how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice .
