Review: seen at the 21st portland international film festival film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast :nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake ,akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film .  .  . funny and pointed in its own way . if you do n't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you .  .  .  . maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through .  having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets ' own war , to get the consumers .  and while this film

Review: from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play - by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we 're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who 's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . nice to see you ,jim .  as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer, can you give us the scoop on the new flick ?jb :my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . one entry was definitely enough , and i 'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 .  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct - to - video . it 's worse than a mediocre made - for - tv feature . i should also mention that this movie like

Review: after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light - hearted departure for quentin tarantino .it 's more of a ho - hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer .the story introduces us to a street - wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another .she works for a bottom - of - the - barrel airline and receives a minimal salary .but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough - nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope .jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation .soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 through to them under nicolet 's nose , with the help of ordell 's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged - out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) .also entering the picture is a bail - bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i wo n't say ) .the big drop - off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double - crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands .it 's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and does n't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so .there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters .the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof .the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie .a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ?you 've got to commend the acting .jackie brown is a seriously dragged - out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes .tarantino 's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear .jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off - screen , so do n't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath .you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the ` n ' word as part of his regular vocabulary .the acting is the glue that holds everything together .grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970 's , is more than adequate for the title character .in fact , she 's flat - out great . another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug - head who goes over the edge .speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell 's bikini - clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .there 's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .which is a life - saver for mr .tarantino .the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake .but oh well .jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work .let 's just hope that the director has n't gone soft on us .
