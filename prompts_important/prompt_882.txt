Review: years ago , robin williams made _ jumanji _ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level . the same can be said for _ what dreams may come _ , a boring , illogical , weepie - wannabe that left my senses numb. do n't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse - pounding imagery . _ brazil_ is on my personal top ten . _ the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios . i even love_ 2001_and _ last year at marienbad _ , being in the minority amidst my friends . _ what dreams may come _ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery . the daring thought it _ does _ have is never fully realized . it 's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises. it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _ mind 's eye _ videos . robin

Review: call me crazy , but i do n't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer .  a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg 's best work , no . personally , if i was spielberg , i would n't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler 's list and the indiana jones movies . i 'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really would n't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika - wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . the difference is , it 's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon 's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it 's damn hard to sit and eat reese 's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . and believe me , the

Review: it was only a matter of time before a dilbert - esque office comedy hit the screens .however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .in his live - action directoral debut , judgeaptly spoofs corporate culture .the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before .. . in other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .he 's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .he 's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but has n't the guts to even introduce himself .everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over - effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .peter 's friends and co - workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . .no , not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend 's sudden change in attitude .but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .ron livingston tackles his role straight - faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .his character is n't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen - like clarity .he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .the animated roots of office space show in the film 's lack of complexity .most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh - and - blood cartoon .however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .it 's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far - fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .
