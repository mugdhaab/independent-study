Review: any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . unfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . teamwork was the key . this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma 's " blow out , " where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . it was travolta 's vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . in this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient( believe that ? ) and sothere 's no fun going on here whatsoever . the st

Review: do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ?do you ?well , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring . unfortunately , there 's a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves . a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo 's character abby relates to it well . like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that . meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman .  .  . uma being the only woman 's name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies . as abby tells her , " you burp and they think it 's cute . you barf and they line up to hold your hair back .

Review: in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison .after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel .fortunately , for audience members there 's a chance to escape the nearest exit .this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy 's worst movie and that 's an accomplishment .remember the golden child , harlem nights ?compared to life , they look like citizen kane .life is long , predictable , foul - mouthed and only intermittently funny .its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years .robert ramsey and matthew stone 's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as " motherf . . .s " or " n . . . . .s ."you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used .and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie .but , like life , it will probably stink .to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up .but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well .life is as sophisticated as a belch .it 's crude and stereotypical .years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second - class people , good for being only maids and servants .for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved .but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies .in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast - talking , conniving , scam artists or hip - hop , gun - crazy , sex - crazed youths .both sets of caricatures are demeaning .and the fault does not rest with the actors .they have to eat , too .it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green - light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest .life 's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds .otherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it .see it at your own risk .
