Review: the original _babe _ was my favorite movie of 1995 ,a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie - ins , which limited its final take . thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . plush dolls , vending machines hawking t - shirts , and macy 's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money - grubbing .  too late . this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _ not _ live up to the original , but it does n't even come to a fraction of it . i should n't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors ' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm.  consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral . imagine with me , if you will , _ scream _ 's jamie kennedy , explaining the " rules " for sequels like babe 2 . ( 1 ) there must be _ more _ talking animals . ( 2

Review: seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater # 6 , by myself for free using my sony / loews critic 's pass . [ theater rating :*** : good seats , sound , and picture ] war is a topic that ca n't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it 's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh - and - blood person and not just a number .  " saving private ryan " is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there 's a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of th

Review: it was only a matter of time before a dilbert - esque office comedy hit the screens .however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .in his live - action directoral debut , judgeaptly spoofs corporate culture .the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before .. . in other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .he 's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .he 's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but has n't the guts to even introduce himself .everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over - effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .peter 's friends and co - workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . .no , not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend 's sudden change in attitude .but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .ron livingston tackles his role straight - faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .his character is n't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen - like clarity .he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .the animated roots of office space show in the film 's lack of complexity .most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh - and - blood cartoon .however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .it 's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far - fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .
