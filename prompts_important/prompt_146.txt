Review: late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr .  ) . the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . the film is a multi - million dollar testament to everything artificial . filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every stepthis is an unquestionable disaster . prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles ' freshman co - ed . at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out - doing the previous in how " cute " it can be . the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze 's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ;

Review: it 's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of " award - winning " tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes .that said , hayes 's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic .but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary .those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film 's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno - deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over - protective , hyper religious , reagan - loving mother .gyllenhall 's sweet - natured delivery of jimmy 's hilariously na ?ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming - of - age story :jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld .his mom home - schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti - sexual messages , until he 's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door .jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss .but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks - addled cross - country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love .the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy 's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film 's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center onoutrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi .but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it 's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags .they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks .but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send - up of a cult called " bright ' nshiny , " led by the inimitable fabio . unfortunately ,a few giggles ca n't make bubble boy the riotous , off - the - wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . honestly ,it 's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i 'm not just saying that because it 's so mediocre . how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that does n't seem to appeal to any particular demographic andhas the potential to offend so many .and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real - life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney 's wondering the same thing .hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .
