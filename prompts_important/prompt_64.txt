Review: hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong 's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u .  s .  productions . such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun - fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo - ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong 's rhythms . the film

Review: as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye - catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . the shot has tibbs ' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . " in the heat of the night " was the first and the best of the three

Review: i admit it .i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies .watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids .it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation .and you know they 'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa 's elves .he later decks a reindeer .hey , man , why do n't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you 're at it ?jingle all the way is formula crap that follows theif someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought .arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene .what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents ca n't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ?arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son .he races from the office to his son 's karate game , only to find out he missed it .and his kid distrusts him because he 's never around .( gee , we have n't seen that in a movie before .) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son 's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago .so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare thanthe tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out .let me back up for a minute here -- arnold 's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief .watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin ' turboman sheets .i 'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it 's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo ,the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who do n't recognize him until the last minute .this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory .most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll .capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful.never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( " your cookies are incredible " ) , it 's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it 's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want .maybe that 's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .
