Review: maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redmanthere 's a world of difference between artists and technicians . the artist has a vision to create something new . he may not do it well, it might be sloppy , but it 's something you 've never seen before . a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it 's going to be just a xerox . obviously successful films need both skills . brian de palma is a masterful technician . he 's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul - dead . in de palma 's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was call

Review: virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . since ' dark city ' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . all the films released after it , have been less successful . david cronenberg 's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . and when ' the thirteenth floor ' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to ' the thirteenth floor ' .  however ,i was positively surprised by josef rusnak 's latest picture . matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood 's action and effects with an

Review: have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ?or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? these thought - provoking questions are the subject of " final destination , " which is the most riveting horror - drama since 1999 's " the sixth sense ." stylishly filmed and tautly directed by " x - files " alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written " teen - speak , " rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars would n't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less - successful , but still suspenseful epilogue .at the start of the film , 17-year - old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris .progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious " coincidences , " including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song " rocky mountain high " over the sound system in the airport bathroom ."john denver died in a plane crash , " alex grudgingly mutters to himself .once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off .arguing in the airport lobby , alex 's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300 + passengers , including the rest of their classmates .as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners .carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate .alex 's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but ca n't because of his fearful parents .the teacher , mrs .lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker .only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex 's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life .that is only the setup of " final destination , " and the less said about what follows , the better .suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife - wielding maniac for the never - seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself .the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and " final destination " surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you do n't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away .devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 's underseen slasher - comedy , " idle hands , " is even more of a charismatic presence here .the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he was n't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part .one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful .ali larter ( 1999 's " varsity blues " ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man -- the exact opposite of her now - deceased father .the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one - dimensional .the movie is mainly sawa 's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles .tony todd ( 1992 's " candyman " ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five - minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory .and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy .ultimately , what is so good about " final destination " is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer - director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten -- two things that are rarely found in today 's horror films .if anything , it 's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .
