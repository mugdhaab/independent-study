Review: one of kyle mclachlan 's earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . plot : a science - fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an " entity " from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this " thing " before it 's too late . critique :this fast - paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra - violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock ' n roll attitude . then again , how can you go wrong with an " alien " that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? !granted , the plot is n't the most elaborate of tales

Review: to sum the entire film " 54 " up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . " 54 " , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk ,told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio " 54 " . phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co - owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender .  .  . you expected more , did n't you . there is n't . the film builds up from nothing and bec

Review: if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch .it starts off as a pulp fiction - type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store .because this is a tarantino movie , however , it 's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it 's a case of a hole being shot through someone 's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away .the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems .clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it .harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex - preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex - pervert tarantino eyes endlessly .you know you 're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she 's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn .the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney 's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet .it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino .once they get to mexico , it 's time to wait at the rendezvous point ,a topless bar called titty twister where we 're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper .finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire .soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back .that 's right, we 've come all this way to see a vampire movie .but like everything else , tarantino takes this age - old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over - the - top entertainment .so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes " a lap dog of satan ."the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100 % tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they 're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second - rate gorefest .clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over - the - top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously .stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there 's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn .pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment .from dusk till dawn is n't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie .
