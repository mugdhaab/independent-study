Review: this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , " the prince of egypt " remains shallow . but i 'll begin from the beginning . the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . maybe it 's just me , butif i knew i had god on my side , i 'd have a little bit more confidence . there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah 's death like it 's nothing but a thing . most of all , though , the story 's focus has shifted .  rather than being a story about father - son , man - ethnicity , man - god , " the princ

Review: you 've got to love disney . no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it 's animated . kids have to go see the movie . then they have to get the toys . oh , the video came out ?got to buy it , or risk little billy 's temper tantrums for the next month . all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . stay at the disneyland hotel !buy a disney t - shirt !eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick !it 's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . dale carnegie should have had it so good . what 's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features

Review: in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , " glory , " but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994 's " legends of the fall , " and 1996 's " courage under fire ."those two films were n't bad , just not very good , but with zwick 's latest film , " the siege , " he has finally made one ."the siege , " is a modern - day action - thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city .investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it .later , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more .they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist .there are some movies that simply do n't need to be made , and , " the siege " may very well be one of them .oh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a " meaningful " action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , " die hard , " which also starred bruce willis .this time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax .whatever points , " the siege , " earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place .the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , " john caprenter 's vampires , " by placing them all in the category of " bad guys ."" the siege , " contains three fine actors --- washington , bening , and shalhoub --- but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development .bening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again ,he has no real character .by the climax of , " the siege , " with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so - called " message " of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , " on deadly ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment ."the siege " is constantly heavy - handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay .
