Review: when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . woody allen has made a couple less - than good films , and he 's my favorite . even martin scorsese has n't had a perfect track record . kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell - out and make the dreadful " mallrats . "i mean , so far the only director who 's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( " slacker , " " dazed and confused , " " before sunrise , " and " suburbia " .  .  . all which were great ) . now , i adore quentin tarantino . his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . but 1995 just was n't that good of a year for him . he made way too many tv appearances . he mispronounced jackie chan 's name on the mtv movie awards . and he made this film . ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . robert rodriguez is a

Review: brian de palma 's snake eyes stars nicolas cage 's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by - the - numbers thriller .ryuichi sakamoto 's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .( the script by de palma and lost world 's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .only the latter is achieved . )cage plays rick santoro ,a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who does n't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog, he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ?that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .the movie 's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .the film takes itself all too seriously .at best , it is a 1940s - style b movie .a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .
