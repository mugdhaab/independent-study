Review: you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing .  .  . and it 's not a comedy !and what a strange career path for director chuck russell . he starts his career off with a decent take on the " nightmare on elm street " series with his debut as director on installment number three . he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . so then he thought , " let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes " ? ! ?strange dude and one crappy flick . plot : a six - year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl 's aunt wants to .  .  . well , save her from those damn devil

Review: more than forty years ago , the " sword and sandals " genre of historical epic ruled the box office . during the 1950 's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . " ben - hur .  "" cleopatra . " " the robe .  "" sparticus . "" the fall of the roman empire .  "" quo vadis . "sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( " the last emperor , " " braveheart " ) and some of the best have been small - screen affairs produced in the 1970 's ( " roots , " " shogun " ) . yet , the phrase " we who are about to die salute you " has been absent until now .

Review: okay, okay .maybe i was n't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it was n't as good as the others .howewer, the latest segal picture did n't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .boy , was i wrong !in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal 's acting , ( he is not simply wooden; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes .by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers .not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense.of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest .in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie .oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other .i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie .often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing .how many movies have psycho ex - special forces bad guys ? too many .i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero 's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . .simply said , this is movie - making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience .my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch .you 'll be looking at it for most of the movie .my .rent die hard .read a book .stare at the sky .do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid .the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly .they probably like wrestling too : - ) .
