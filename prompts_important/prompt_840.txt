Review: with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft 's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top - selling game franchise , is visually awe - inspiring and groundbreaking . no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ?obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail: individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they do n't sync perfectly really sta

Review: an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well - worn material .the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop-- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .the reason ?mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .or if our passports were n't missing .
