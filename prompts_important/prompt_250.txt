Review: this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . "but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she 's watching . we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper / killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest does n't keep him from offering pursuit . lacrosse 's most recent trek takes him to a blood - soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the loca

Review: mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv - show er . her mast famous episode , " love 's labour lost " , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood 's big blockbuster movies . so it 's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . it 's long and drawn out , and i would h

Review: brian de palma 's snake eyes stars nicolas cage 's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by - the - numbers thriller .ryuichi sakamoto 's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .( the script by de palma and lost world 's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .only the latter is achieved . )cage plays rick santoro ,a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who does n't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog, he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ?that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .the movie 's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .the film takes itself all too seriously .at best , it is a 1940s - style b movie .a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .
