Review: forget get carter . instead .  .  .  get me a cup of coffee . what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?when did all of the bad - ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun - toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980 's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary - eyed knuckleheads . the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i do n't mean new york city . get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber - thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80 's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportuni

Review: i know that " funnest " is n't a word . " fun " is a noun , and therefore can not be conjugated like an adjective . but that 's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . "no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i 've ever seen !" so to hell with webster 's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i 've seen in a while . i ca n't remember the last time i 've seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy 's farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp - like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and t

Review: i 'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it 's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power - mongering .if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history .it has already been well - documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re - cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors ' guild - mandated pseudonym of alan smithee .that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor .and you could just smell the disaster brewing .if you 're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you 'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up .ostensibly , it 's a pseudo - documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big - budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) .when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called " an alan smithee film " -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it .among the parties interviewed are the film 's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them .it 's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes .what makes it even worse is eszterhas ' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times .michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg / ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas ' stock - in - trade .the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film .by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film - makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified .those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what 's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn .not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears .the producer is a " liar " who " slept in the white house ; " the media are " maggots " and " leeches " working for publications like " the new york slimes " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you do n't miss the joke ) .it does n't even matter that eszterhas tags " penile implant " after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self - deprecation .this is a petulant schoolboy 's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth .the last stomach - churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out - takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away .perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himselfthere was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career .pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego - driven " satire " of excess and ego .it 's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this .otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .
