Review: actually , i 'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . " baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep herdouble - d 's on the small screen . at least there you do n't have to pay to see her cleavage . and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless ,hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full - fledged nude scenes in barb wire . you would n't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . i ca n't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her toplessbut if she is nude , it 's so quick you ca n't even tell for sure whether you 're seeing her andersons or not . a nipple hallucination sort of thing . barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interestin

Review: defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer - director albert brooks , who also stars in the comedy . after dying in a car crash , on his birthday of all days , brooks wakes up in judgement city , a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings . brooks has five days to convince two judges that he 's worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence . enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant . during his " trial , " brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen , and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant . it 's impossible to resist chuckling ( and cringing ) at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth . torn , in particular , is in vintage comic form , and he walks away with the picture . the movie also features meryl streep , appealingas the love - intere

Review: mars attacks !( 1996 )- c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones .this is director tim burton 's finest film to date .many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films .however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 .you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film .it is completely wacked - out and unlike anything you 've ever seen .once the silly tone of the film is set , it 's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do n't mix .the plot is simple : martians invade the earth .but it 's different than any other invasion film .usually it 's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans .this time however , it 's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans .the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i 've seen in a long time.they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious .and about the special effects .the effects in mars attacks ! are just about the most flawless ones i 've seen to date .the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 % real .there are just a couple of scenes that do n't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship .also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise .but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .could it have been funnier ?certainly . was it funny enough ?yes .was i entertained ? absolutely .on a personal note , i 'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war - crazy general decker .finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see .while he 's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in ,he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue .the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him .
