Review: as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragoni thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film. with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa . attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half - gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to

Review: a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african - american . an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho 's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . it 's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . this sleazy pic , soon became grating a

Review: that is , unless you 're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters .i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away .why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me .however , if they * had n't * given it away , the film would 've still been suprisingly devoid of suspensegiven its subject matter .obviously , the producers thought they could remake " the deep end of the ocean , " throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama ." double jeopardy " offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he did n't see to be on screen half as much as judd did .it also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full - of - tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot .half the time i 'm wondering whether i 'm watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised .judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too .the movie 's stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . implausible material , no less . loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , " that is * not * possible* ." that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like " double jeopardy " that tries to pass itself off as serious drama .everything seems dragged out , overplayed .when they should 've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early .
