Review: jean - claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun . his latest film , " knock off , " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless . you ca n't really blame van damme . no one , i suspect , has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . and even his sidekick co - star , " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin ' copies " schneider , does what 's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man . no ,the problem with the film is its direction . the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible .  .  . and it goes downhill from there !five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes . van damme does n't land his first kick until after thirty -- too late for most action fans -- and by the time the hour mark has rolled around ,your jaw w

Review: in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy 's jack ryan series , _ the_fugitive _ , and last year 's smash _ air_force_one _ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . apparently , it was just lying dormant . with ivan reitman 's enjoyable romantic comedy / adventure_ six_days ,_ seven_nights _ ,the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropicswhose broken - down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt - of - the - earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is ex

Review: starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .freeway is giving me second thoughts .freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul - mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) .to top that pathetic premise off-- reese goes to visit granny and you 'll never guess who 's waiting under the cover 's in granny 's bed .keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star .sowhat are they doing in this movie ?after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .the answer is quite simple --i do nt want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .note to keifer: you wonder why you are n't a bigger star in hollywood ? because you keep making movies like this .note to reese: you were great in fear , what happened this time ?note to both: do n't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway .bottom line --i 'm still shaking my head .do n't waste your time on this turkey . if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns .reese witherspoon 's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller .do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- butstay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .
