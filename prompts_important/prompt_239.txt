Review: disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . unfortunately , folks , it 's not likely . dante 's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent .  to be honest , i was n't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , did n't make it sound promising . soi was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie was n't bad at all . it 's pretty run of the mill , but it 's not something i would say is merely " ok " to watch . in case you do n't know , dante 's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it 's shadow , dante 's peak ( who would 've guessed , eh ? ) . pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . due to the

Review: apparantly money talks . .  . and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !i 've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you . i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does !it 's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged . perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word . money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) . franklin is your typical con - man and ends up with more than one person out to get him . when the plot finally gets underway , there 's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive . the frenchman who 's somewhat responsible 
Important Phrases: ['it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged', 'both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear', 'another wasted element', 'there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non - relevant , or just plain forgotten about', 'a paint - by - numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience', 'frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two - dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money']

Review: under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review .however , in order to fully explain exactly how and whythis movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary .even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk .the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm 's past patients .distraught ,the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself .cut to the " next fall " , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i did n't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) .after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has " the sixth sense " , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead .and this , as they say , is where the healing begins .the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert 's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of " siskel and ebert " ) .although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i 've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film 's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i 've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated .and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment .stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion .after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power .it 's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature - length movie .in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth - shattering revelation that is yet to come .and when the final moments do come , it 's a huge letdown; the end makes no sense at all .it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level .i wo n't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder .now , in all fairness , i can not say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be )had it not been revealed to me before hand .however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few " twilight zone " episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away .the fact that movie - goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped .ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl 's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy .i would n't have even known about this mental disease if i had n't , by pure dumb luck , caught " dateline nbc " the other week when they did a feature story on it .despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk - full of contradictions and just is n't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .
