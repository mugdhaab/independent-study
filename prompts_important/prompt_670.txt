Review: the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . alas , it refers to our heroes !as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . but the human race does n't have much to worry about . after all , there 's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis )out there stopping the computer virus . she 's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . they 're all sailing in a

Review: jonathan demme 's _ beloved _ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison 's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story 's main events . this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story 's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow. indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it can not be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . _ beloved _ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so - called reconstruction era after the civil war . for newly - freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio

Review: what would inspire someone who can not write or act to pen and star in a movie ?a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? if you have an answer , let me know .foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw - droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming valuesocially , cinematically or otherwise .comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand - up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for .master p stars as fifty dollah '( beat that ! )as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club / act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert 's " idiot plot ," if everyone here was n't an idiot , there would be no problem ) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?not a hell of a lot .as i have mentioned , master p can not act or write.he acts like the rapper that he is .the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .if you have n't yet figured it out , that is not saying much .co - star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand - up and otherwise .he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , andwhile i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .and indeed , i laughed at a few stand - up scenes here , but from a feature - length movie i expect more .foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry - sporting sibling " you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush " ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion" huh ?" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard - earned $ 8 .you 'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you do n't have cable .eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away . & # 137 ;
