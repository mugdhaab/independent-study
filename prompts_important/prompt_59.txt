Review: seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with ` dark city ' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully - constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . there 's an old role - playing computer game called ` d ?ja v ? 'wherein the player takes on the role of a man who ca n't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we do n't have control over the protagonist .

Review: one - sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best - selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do . for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 andcause chaos here on earth . we 're still here . the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick - off the apocalypse . we 're still here . some of the more ludicrous moments come when it 's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . also , there 's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . if it 's anything l

Review: die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film 's pathetic screenplay .every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs .so much for the script .how about the action ?well , let 's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator --all standouts for their hair - raising suspense .by contrast , harlin does n't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so badit 's good .you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .
