Review: logical time travel movies are a near - impossibility .  considering that the skeptic 's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . occasionally , we get a film that does manage it . terry gilliam 's " 12 monkeys " was one such film . but more frequently , we get films that do n't much deal with it at all . there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?the " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action , " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story , and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . is " frequency " filled with plot holes ?yes . does it matter ?not really . the film opens in october of 1969 . firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes ho

Review: susan granger 's review of " the watcher " ( universal ) just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking - clock cat - and - mouse game with james spader , a burnt - out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there 's spader 's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell .

Review: bats is this year 's camp flick .with the world 's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity .as for the rest of us , well . . .i 'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway .follow their lead and you 'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot .i love alfred hitchcock 's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based .it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror / schlock such as bats .when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate .it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious .why has he done this , you ask ?because , you see , it is apparently a scientist 's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind .so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world .of course , that ca n't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture .consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave .the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out .what do they do ?do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ?nope .they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes .what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes .we do n't even get to see what 's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick .all we know is that bats are attacking .how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery .a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some .of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it does n't really go anywhere.most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist 's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats !" some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept .i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one - liners .playing such characters does not help actors ' careers .still , i suppose that if you 're looking for a movie that is " so badit 's good , " you could do worse than bats .it does have a tremendous amount of camp value .i 'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly ,it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .more power to them .
