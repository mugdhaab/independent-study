Review: everything in the phantom you have seen many times before andthere is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .billy zane is wooden as the hero .kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of .oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity butthis is so poorly played out you wo n't even care .about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery .however , if you re looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper .this is not a good movie .
