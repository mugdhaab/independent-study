Review: has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small - town deputy sheriff corralled into co - coaching the school 's hastily formed soccer team . his partner - in - crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer - city audience is to teach them something neat . like soccer . most of the good - natured gags are of the fast - motion variety , such as runaway cows and out - of - control lawnmowers . kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what 's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . instead of a peppy pop score , w

Review: up until about a year ago , john travolta 's career consisted of those " look who 's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who 's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight - to - the - cutout - bin album aptly named " sizeis n't everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . but now travolta 's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . four words : contract with the devil . and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich 's " contract with america . "no , satan is much more humane . anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to th

Review: it seems like i 'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now .scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again - the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the " relentless " department .i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it 's citizen hook .jennifer love - hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james - who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking up .she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman - victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals .paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station 's 4th of july getaway giveaway .bikini - ready julie invitesboyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who - and here 's the movie 's biggest mystery - turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take - off . until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell - liner himself , that is .unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla 's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy - next - door type who 's sweet on julie .to make a long story short - i ca n't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set - up for this gratuitous sequel - the trip is a disaster .not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners ' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one - by - one , but the karaoke machine is n't working properly !( you think killing is hard ?try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor 's " i will survive" now contains the lyric" i still know what you did last summer ! " )all is not lost - ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co .this picture is really about breasts : two of them .julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan .based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i ca n't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me- he gets jennifer love - hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp !lucky bastard .i did n't likei know what you did last summerand i ca n't say i liked this continuation any more or less .the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ?i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis 's random selection of victims .( i do n't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest ideawhat julie did last summer . )director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one - if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here 's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series - someone who wo n't rely on so many shock notes .and let that person run wild with the camera .( aside : if blandy [ sic ] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says " baby " to a minimum .thanks in advance . )
