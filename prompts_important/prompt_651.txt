Review: i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival .  ' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation ' , the headlines read . intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . even though the movie was extremely well - received by critics and public alike, i could n't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . only now do i see the error of my ways . after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a " holocaust comedy " ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who

Review: the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . with she 's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . however , you would n't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . they have accidentally killed one of their own , the " teen dream " , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . it takes little time at all for the group 's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique 's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . to make things worse , another stude

Review: i 'm giving this stinker .normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be .but the total waste of timethat is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg .i 'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all .maybe in mel 's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny .in mine , it 's not .or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking .because only the self - righteous lee uses the n - word more often in his films than brooks did in this one .at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing .brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it .wrong mel !i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere .this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor 's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out .but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them .the governor pawns the task off to korman 's character hedley lamarr .( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . )lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave .hold on , i 've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass .it 's just too funny .racism passing as humor-- gosh why did n't anybody ever think of that one before ?oh wait, i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk .i 'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who would n't know what was funny if it hit him over the head .but i digress .anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n - word .golly , will the hilarity just never end ?he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west .together , they save the day from evil . not one person in this movie gives a decent performance.wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie .ok , he really did n't -- but he should have .the films star cleavonlittle goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day .i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience .i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions .actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , butalas, it ended up being as crappyas the rest of the movie .i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .
