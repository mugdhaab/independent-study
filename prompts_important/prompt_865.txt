Review: based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider - man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half - vampire half - human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire 's latest meal . now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . his latest challenge is his biggest though .  .  . he must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . to some degree , i agree with this sentiment . having read comic books since the age
Important Phrases: ['the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match', 'creating an appropriate atmosphere', 'dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes', 'while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch', 'is the saving grace', 'he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust', 'a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps']

Review: robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects . he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her . they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash . just when it could n't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr .  )annie ca n't take the grief anymore , and kills herself . ( all sounding like good fun so far ? )the ' penalty ' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow .  )based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar . this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made . everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audience
Important Phrases: ['everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters', 'performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film', "she ca n't act", "it 's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement", 'a soppy script', 'haphazard', "it 's all rather boring", 'just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid', 'proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment', 'it raises boredom']

Review: in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg 's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas ' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .in january of this year , lucas re - released star wars on its 20th anniversary .in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer - generated jabba the hutt , do n't do much but call attention to themselves .other than these , the film is exactly the same .why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you have n't seen it .the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi - wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .he and kanoby then , joined by two inter - galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker 's two droids d2 and c3po( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .the film is obviously quite star - studded .but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones ' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?it just happened to work out for him .the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker 's triumph is symbolized by the audience 's sense of becoming something larger than life itself - a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . ,
