Review: ** * * * * minor plot spoilers in review** * * * * * * * * * *no major spoilers are in review** * * * * the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them . the ridley scott 's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . james cameron 's aliens was much more of an action film . and i liked each film separately for which it was . now alien 3 is out . and it is it 's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypers

Review: it 's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james ' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . she ca n't concentrate on her schoolwork , ca n't get a good night 's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . in the first movie , ` i know what you did last summer ' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr .  ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her co

Review: if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late - night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80 's , they 'd agree d .c .cab is the quintessential " usa up all nite " movie .it 's one of those childish r - rated movies that kids would love but ca n't see until it 's edited for tv .it 's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs .and , strike three , it pairs mr .t with gary busey .i heard gilbert say d .c .cab had " an all - star cast , " buti 'm still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement .when third - billing goes to a two - minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara " as herself , " you ca n't say a damn thing about all - star casts .likewise for token appearances by marsha " roz " warfield , paul rodriguez and" politically incorrect " host bill maher , before he was somebody .appearing in d .c .cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene" i 'm gon na live forever " cara .d .c .cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs .you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the " token white guy " ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word " honkey " as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr .t -- a real stretch for him ), the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) .we 've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80 's .some are fun to watch and some are actually funny .this one is more or less neither .you 'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d .c .cab more or lessfalls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him .it 's a shameno one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality .d .c .cab has rightly earned its position on " usa up all nite .
