Review: sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . but by the attentiveness of the crowd i 'd say they were won over - as was i. i ca n't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . time alone will make that call . but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank 's side . we were concerned for his well - being , and wanted him to win . that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little forek

Review: renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean - claude van damme on the action star 's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _ double_team _ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels ,_ knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . writer steven e . desouza 's fairly straightforward plotline is n't as outre as _double_team _ 's strange yarn involving a secret think tank / prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong - based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip - sized bombs in hk product exports to

Review: bruce willis is a type - casted actor .in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over - the - hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes .in luc besson 's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time .a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element 's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 .an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the " 5 elements " are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back .cut to present day , which is our future .the year is 2023 , and new york is the city .the only basic differences between besson 's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats !anyway , the " evil " comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise - like aliens to return the " 5 elements " to earth , in order to defend themselves against the " evil ." in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing .when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand .what can you do with a hand ?hey , its the 21st century here - dna reconstruction !this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) .she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben 's floating cab .it 's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy - as - always cops .when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the " yellow pages " and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties .now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements .it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean - baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) .he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig - like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) .in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem - why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ?the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered .but enough of that .when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruction .the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm ,an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson 's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich .the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim " tiny " lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film .although besson 's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point .some other directors ( like anaconda 's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy - using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film .sci - fi fan or not ,any movie - lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture . ,
