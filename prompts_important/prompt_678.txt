Review: synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves .meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?it 's hard to speculate .most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar .in case you have n't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom - of - the - barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .there 's really not much to say .the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist 's agent .he is so horrible in this role that one ca n't help but be amused .the plot sucks .nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .the dialogue stinks .a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really does n't need to know .everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits .as the names of the not - so - talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist ."someone could have used an editor !to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here .i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie .why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i 'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
