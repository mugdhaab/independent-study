Review: "the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it 's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually , if you 've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . but he 's afflicted with loser - itis . dogs attack him, neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him . truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we 'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . this is actually bad because you ca n't like a character if you ca n't develop sympathy for him . we never do ,
Important Phrases: however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn, equally tenuous, this element does n't work the first time it 's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence, it 's too bad that she 's in such a mediocre offering

Review: when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input .jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer - generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone .i 'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe - filled response .an all - powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture - like skeksis .the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great " conjunction " of three suns .along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay - like kira , an ogre - witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic - but - friendly , tumbleweed - like animal named fizzgig .much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design .the puppeteering is phenomenal -- observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase -- but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately - narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue .the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone - perfect .as well , trevor jones ' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character .i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it could n't be helped , but i wish the film was longer .jen and kira have wonderful . . .well , chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated .the dark crystal has a very small cult following .the weaker labyrinth is probably better - known , which is upsetting .a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth 's creatures due to the financial failure of people - less the dark crystal .that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid - trip episode of " the muppet show " with david bowie as guest - host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien 's fan - base .( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . )the dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience .it 's the best kind of children 's entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageouslyun - hip .brian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father 's masterpiece .
