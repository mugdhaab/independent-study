Review: let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . it is so full of self - parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre - credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it 's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule - the - world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore 's 007

Review: matthew broderick and high school comedy . the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . ferris buehler 's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . but election is far different . this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . tracy flick
Important Phrases: ['does so much more than entertain', 'a realistic portrayal', "that is much of this film 's beauty", "could n't have been any more perfect for this role", 'is far superior', 'simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes', 'that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part', 'she is just marvelous']

Review: all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands .thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away .your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon .it is n't just the strobe light quality of your twenty - cuts - per - minute editing , or the numbing over - use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . ."no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles .welcome to the club , scott kalvert .your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one - dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole .dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet / songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based .as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) .one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin .jim 's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school .along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower .the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner .screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll 's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends .as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , butas drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie .jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo - sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out .perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd .without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung - out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack .director scott kalvert does n't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , sohe substitutes silly slow - motion photography , self - consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective .mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is .they also do n't allow leonardo dicaprio 's performance to be as strong as it could have been .for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics .dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex - junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert wo n't let character interaction define this story .he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting .at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio 's talents .far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .
