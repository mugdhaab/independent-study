Review: the last of vampire - films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing . jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican . his and his men 's mission is to clean the earth from vampires . they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them . valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself . for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross . with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight . after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth .  .  . i have never liked john carpenter and his style . after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed . john carpenter remains john carpenter . however , because of the film 's self - irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his gre

Review: the happy bastard 's 30-second review :american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty .  if you go expecting dawson 's creek , you 're in for a problem . if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv 's own eugene levy as a happy - go - lucky dad . the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid . that 's pretty much it . throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i wo n't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry . of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they do n't drag the movie 's humor content down that bad . most of

Review: you 'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .that 's a bit more difficult .the farfetched sci - fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .if you 're not nice to it , you lose .galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks 's spaceballs was to star wars ,an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean - spirited or malintentioned ."the show 's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over ."that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that 's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show 's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .jason nesmith( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .dane , who played a spock - like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character 's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar 's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die - hard fans .one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers .they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film 's only mean - spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .of course , they all think he is out of his mindand once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .taking shots at both the obvious and not - so - obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub 's fred a .k .a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " ,chen 's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , wo n't take it or something ." it 's a hoot , but it does n't stop there :weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier - than - thou attitude are n't far behind .galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it 's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments --it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .by grabthar 's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .
