Review: the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " . so i did n't expect too much from this . but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . i thought , mabe it will be fun ?and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . but by the end of it i thought :why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . here is the story : in the monstrously over - decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbin

Review: " return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once .the film tells the story of a low - budget horror movie being filmed at the closed - down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .but what the cast and crew do n't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again .on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on .watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i could n't help but take notice that the killer 's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 ." on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout .unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat .and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind - the - scenes " look at an exploitation film being made .the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be .and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever,and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time .there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through .if you see the film , or have seen it , you 'll know what i mean .the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place .but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene .well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in .but other than that two - minute distraction , " return to horror high , " iscertainly no great shake .note :look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film .and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . .literally .
