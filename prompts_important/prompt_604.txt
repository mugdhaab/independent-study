Review: thistalky , terribly - plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex - new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light - plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat .he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that 's when the trouble begins .the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) .everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that 's curious but never compelling .based on the book by james lee burke , heaven 's prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing .early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves .nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa .later , dave is reunited with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation .huh ?the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf .whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess .in its present form , heaven 's prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .
