Review: at the outset of swordfish , john travolta 's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this ?by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie 's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is. this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly tha

Review: to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .also , a beautifully anti - climactic ending .not to say it did n't look intriguing when i saw the previews .so much for truth in advertising .roland emmerich , who 's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co - writed and directed this inane sci - fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .it would n't be till present day ( ' 94 ) till they would actually figure it out .they 're decipherer ?a slightly - neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr .dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who 's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?so there is a hokey ending !duh !he figures it out in about a minute .yea .and then they get a suicidal colonel or something, " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat - top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .why a suicidal colonel ?for the ending !you 'll get the hang of this .they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .after an overdone special effects thing , they 're . . .inside a goddam pyramid .so they went to egypt ,right ?wrong .they 're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .yea .also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .an anti - climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo - pseudo - pseudo - character development .by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i do n't know , the " outer limits " or something .the script 's terrible .the special effects are okay , but nothing great .the story 's so weak that it 's almost opaque.the whole experience just is n't worth it unless you 're so bored that you 'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . .or this .i 'd pick this , obviously , but still ,it 's just not fun at all .and i ca n't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
