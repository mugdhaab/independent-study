Review: okay, okay .maybe i was n't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it was n't as good as the others .howewer, the latest segal picture did n't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .boy , was i wrong !in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal 's acting , ( he is not simply wooden; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes .by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers .not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense.of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest .in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie .oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other .i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie .often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing .how many movies have psycho ex - special forces bad guys ? too many .i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero 's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . .simply said , this is movie - making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience .my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch .you 'll be looking at it for most of the movie .my .rent die hard .read a book .stare at the sky .do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid .the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly .they probably like wrestling too : - ) .
