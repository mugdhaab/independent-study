Review: everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with " progress . "giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . his house looks like an immaculate museum ?with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he 's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three - dimensional human being . despite his tunnel vision , it 's impossible not to like the man , especially after h

Review: much ado about nothing . ah , how sweet the irony !it 's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . he just does n't " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . the bard 's work is apparently beyond criticism . what a load of old cobblers . if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh 's film of shakespeare 's " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word, it 's time to get a life . get monty python . get woody allen . get john waters . whatever . just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy .  and banish this nonsenseto where it belongs . drama and tragedy was shakespeare 's strength . to my sensibilities - and i 'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in m

Review: that is , unless you 're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters .i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away .why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me .however , if they * had n't * given it away , the film would 've still been suprisingly devoid of suspensegiven its subject matter .obviously , the producers thought they could remake " the deep end of the ocean , " throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama ." double jeopardy " offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he did n't see to be on screen half as much as judd did .it also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full - of - tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot .half the time i 'm wondering whether i 'm watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised .judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too .the movie 's stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . implausible material , no less . loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , " that is * not * possible* ." that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like " double jeopardy " that tries to pass itself off as serious drama .everything seems dragged out , overplayed .when they should 've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early .
