Review: based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i wo n't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box - office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . can you say .  .  . the third times not a charm ? plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation 's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . critique :i did not laugh once during this entire picture . when you consider that this film is a part - comedy , that 's not a very good sign . i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes .

Review: on re - watching italian writer / director dario argento 's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . while it 's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . h

Review: one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often - acclaimed director sidney lumet 's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in.when a movie is over , are n't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and # 2 , even if i had been with someone there would n't have been anything to talk about in the first place .to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven - year - old boy 's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean - luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she did n't commit and returns to her ex - boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .gloria is the type of fast - talking , smart - mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( do n't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even thoughi ca n't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it is n't completely unbearable to watch .i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by - the - numbers .throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ?" as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over - the - top brooklyn accent that honestly does n't sound realistic at all .in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone 's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .jean - luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria 's friend whom she turns to for help .sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i do n't blame them .they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high - profile people involved .although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p .m .showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 's " casino " or 1996 's " last dance " if you do n't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .
