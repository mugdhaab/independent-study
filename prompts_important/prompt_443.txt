Review: expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature - length film and you 've got baby 's day out -- an agreeably amusing children 's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . the plot tracks a trio of crooks - posed - as - photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine - month - old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old - money home . but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago !following the path of his favorite story , called " baby 's day out , " baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site . while baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear . the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries .

Review: it 's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix , " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial - killer genre ( " kiss the girls , " " se7en " ) . the result should have been more interesting than " the cell . "as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that 's never fully explained . after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report . meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . although carl 's been doing this for awhile , he 's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak

Review: i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .take the professional , for example .it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .it 's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle - aged man and a twelve - year - old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d .e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda 's father tried to rip him off .leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .writer / director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close - ups and evocative lighting .but beneath the shiny wrapper , there is n't nearly as much going onas besson would like us to believe .the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he 's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she does n't have too much to work with , either .besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .gary oldman 's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild - eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .there is n't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which is n't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve - year - old in a really distasteful way .there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda 's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he 's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman 's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9 mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world ca n't disguise that fact .
