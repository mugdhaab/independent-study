Review: so ask yourself what " 8 mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?is it about the business itself ,how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big - town americana , there 's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wo n't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ?or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?i 'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . i 'm talking about films like " 8 mm " and its director , joel schumacher . with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence
Important Phrases: ['probably not', 'a fairly conventional missing persons drama', 'tags on a ridiculous self - righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further', 'there are better ways to waste two hours of your life', 'shocking only in its banality']

Review: apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i do n't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i 've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye 's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . it 's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton 's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard
Important Phrases: ['i found american history x to be an extremely good film', 'a powerful , charismatic performance', 'his work in american history x is one of the very best performances', 'kaye has found the right note for his material', "he 's perfect for this role", 'the other performances are all terrific', 'the film is very powerful', 'most of them work nicely', 'the climactic scene is very moving', 'american history x manages to make a compelling argument']

Review: if you 've been following william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he 's played some rather similar roles over the years .like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .or colonel williamsharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny -- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard - hitting roles .which is why his performance in " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is such a shock , such a delight .in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog - loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner 's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .it borders on offensive but does n't really manage it .and it borders on clich ?d stereotype butdoes n't quite succumb to that definition either .in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal -- but he 's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devitoso how could that be possible ? )moviegoing experience .fichtner 's performance does n't exactly save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommending " what 's the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor 's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film 's rating from no stars to one - and - a - half .thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down -- way , way , down -- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movieso dull and pedestrian and nonsensicalit does n't even warrant discussion .
