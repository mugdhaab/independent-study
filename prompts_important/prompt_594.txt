Review: this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont 's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . she 's going on a cruise with her new boy - friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . they sacked him after he got sick . now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship 's safe for compensation . that actually is the whole storyline . speed 2 could do without dialogues . the movie is all about images and remarkable sound . i do n't really know why this is called an action movie .  except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the

Review: 1992 's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself -- box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979 's alien and 1986 's aliens , savaged david fincher 's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean - pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two - fold challenge -- not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once - profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devisesa quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem -- clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third

Review: director doug ellin 's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story .like a sitcomwith jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it ,the movie meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame .the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless linesyou 've heard before .( " i 'm not wearing any underwear , " the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure - fire come - on line . )max , chicago 's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha .max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience .max is played without any style by david schwimmer .schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover .his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair .after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why should n't the personality - challenged be attracted ?the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test .jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act .max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does .the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work .neither the script nor the actors make this test believable ."the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you 're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ?" jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film .finally , there is the film 's attempt at physical comedy .jay 's ex - girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .natasha rips jay 's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa .as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it .this is supposed to be funny ?most films have some saving grace .some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture was n't . kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it .kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 .it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .
