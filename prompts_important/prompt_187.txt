Review: " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel - good antics . and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . he ends up falling for the preacher 's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second - rate . sowhy did i enjoy it so much ? for one thing ,the cast is great . kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . we 're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon does n't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort . yes , he does rebel , but he 's also polite when he needs to be . and he never broods . the rest of the cast is

Review: numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci - fi , suspense thrillers . soldier is a multi ?crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ?not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . russell who is usually a good actor in b - grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ?sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie - like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul ander
Important Phrases: ['should have been put down', 'a real mongrel', 'the action is mediocre', 'laboured , slow and sluggish', 'almost no dialogue', 'a long way from anything considered desirable']

Review: the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it 's only 80 minutes long and when it 's overyou 're glad that you did n't waste more than an hour and a half of your time.it 's nothing more than a bad rip - off of , " jaws" ( and i think that 's being kind . )it was written by david e .kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror - comedy butfails at both , miserably.i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once .the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda ."the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt )flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .there 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .as i mentioned before kelley and director steveminor ( h20 ) do n't go for a serious approach towards the material butthey also do n't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they 're all basically idiots .if they had any brains the croc would n't have been that much of a challenge to catchand they would n't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movie .basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
