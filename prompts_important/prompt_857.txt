Review: the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is . it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously . mr . gregg " i'm - having - a - mid - life - crisis" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world . and how does he show it ?by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this . oh , and it gets better . a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of ,oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i 'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) . in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of" do you ever wonder what life is all a

Review: upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .i 'm twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters .director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavilydo we sense any trouble .in the quiet after the music we muse that it 's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate 's hold of the family is n't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .note : this is the first movie review i 've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .: )
