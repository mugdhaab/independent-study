Review: movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in ' 95 , but i wanted to re - write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . this picture was so bad, it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . so , it does indeed have some plusses .  .  . in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) far too annoying far too often . like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i did n't care one little iota about the main

Review: what a great film . what a stunning , touching , heart - wrenching , heart - warming , life - affirming , miraculous film . > from its opening moments, _ life is beautiful _ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . heil !heil !huh ?shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti - semitic society in which he = lives . granted , _ the great dictator _ comes to mind --charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character .

Review: sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst . a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , " the specialist " is about as exciting as an episode of " dragnet , " and about as well acted .even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness . who knew a big explosion could beso boring andanti - climactic ?unless you saw " blown away " . . ."the specliast " of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback # 19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit - like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over - the - top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job .his credo is killing bad people , not innocents .and that 's why he makes big bombs .so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend / moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban / miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) .turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young .so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e - mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked .yea .also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly .using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must - be - improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open .these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film .the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake - eyes .it 's just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time .and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic - looking special effects (a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) .then there 's the much - discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on " friends ." their sex scene is more nauseatingthen sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone .now let 's guess who we 'd rather see naked , okay ?stone 's small but perky breasts , which we 've seen more times than harvey keitel 's dick , or stallone 's veiny ass , which is n't usually shown for a very good reason ?i know i ca n't really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on .the worst flaw of the film is this : it 's boring.i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting .but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make .if you 're in for some fun action , rent sly 's earlier " demolition man , " which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion .skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger 's accent , or see stone 's breasts again .
