Review: the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go seel . a .  confidential again . or go rent body heat , to see william hurtdo some real noir . or even -- god help me -- palmetto . alex proyas 's new movie screams atmosphere . i screamed , too , " get me out of this theater !"new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and does n't have any way to get it back . i paid $ 4 . 25 for a matinee screening and do n't have any way to get my money back , either . you 'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie . i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it 's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras . i 've got news for you fellows --i do n't care how hard you worked

Review: towards the middle of " the sweet hereafter , " a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight . then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow - covered field . it pauses for a moment before the " field " cracks under the bus ' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time . compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of " titanic , " when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you 'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . the scene in " the sweet hereafter " epitomizes all that 's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan 's film . it 's not sensational . we do n't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about . the bus does n't explode or break in
Important Phrases: ['attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable', 'splendidly']

Review: the small - scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . filled with breathtaking scenery , ' characters ' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot .the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny .what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds .the village consists of several amusing characters .a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch .there 's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up - and - up .there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .pacing is right .towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that 's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we 've been interested in the goings on .a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment- all the right emotions are engaged .in one brief dream sequence - you 'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .one of the key moments in the film .the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939 - 2 ) follows the same arc as the movie andis well worth considering . a fine film that 's for everybody except action fans .somewhat like ' the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . .but livelier .
