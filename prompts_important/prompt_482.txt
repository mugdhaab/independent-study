Review: the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i 'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid. screwed perfectly suits the latter description . what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt , scott alexander and lar

Review: there was a lot riding on this movie . everyone even moderately interested in the " scream " series was dying to know how it would end . what would be the " final act " ?this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into " scream " while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . no need to worry ; " scream 3 " is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self - referential , post - modern tradition of quentin and co . so , how does the story go ?as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all - grown -

Review: " easely one of the worst films of the year . ." with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century .this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil .the result is somewhat predictable .i did n't have high hopes about arnold 's " much anticipated " return to the big screen .schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers wo n't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry .everyone else will see ' end of days ' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture .think of it as hollywood 's own y2k bug .did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you 'll get 999 , as in 1999 ?yes , you better believe it . .satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days .this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold .he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc .the way it works is he smirks and something explodes .before the stroke of the new millennium he 's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations .only schwarzenegger 's cop attached to an anti - terrorist unit can stop him .films like this has one serious weakness -- logic .no matter how you twist the " plot " , you 'll find it incredibly stupid( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) .the incredible fact is that such directors never learn .after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? .here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution .he is walking around n .y ., blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius .all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special .but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks, he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter .so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . .i can give you happiness that you can only dream of . .just give me the address . ." indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller .and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger 's comeback , will not be very satisfied .we 've not seen him in a while .that 's because he did n't have a worthy opponent .he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars .he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop .so , after all those fights , what 's left for arnold schwarzenegger ?how about satan ?in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron 's " terminator " .and that is schwartzenegger 's strength -- muscles and no emotions .here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar .this is called " an adult turn" if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful . make a wild guess !his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .this requires at least some acting skills .regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles .the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters .the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting .but the movie does n't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry .the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular .soi really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . unless you are a die - hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away .as for schwarzenegger , he 'll be back .
