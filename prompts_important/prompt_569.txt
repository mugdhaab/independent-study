Review: "you 'll go ape over tarzan because it 's more fun than a barrel of monkeys !"okay , there 's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . disney 's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . it 's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard .  against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . tarzan is not so much a story about a human

Review: if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer 's biggest pleasures . if only . in fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another ,the filmmakers bombard us with used - up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one .  take the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff . after being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead . but suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he 's only injured . a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it . did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip - off ?appa

Review: seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater # 3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .[ theater rating :*** : good seats , sound , and picture ] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it 's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .phillip 's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer 's disease - is n't this rather lowbrow comedy ?he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids ' movie if i ever saw one ) .we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he 's forgotten .sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she 'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it 's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip 's ideas , but his woman too .what 's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .it 's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip 's absent - mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .but it 's clear how weak this premise is from the get - go and the film just gets worse .all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast - moving , flubber - powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that do n't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .it 's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there 's no rules about jumping too high . "" predictable " does n't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .and it 's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it 's the way it 's broken down scene - by - scene , with absolutely no transition .not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .i 'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , soit 's almost forgivable when you realize they 're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .it 's safe to say everything that could be bad about" flubber " is .the only original element the film has is the world 's first romance between a machine and a human .but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you wo n't .
