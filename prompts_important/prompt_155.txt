Review: " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute - long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that . this movie is so stupid and dumb that it 's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . i 'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death . of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths butit comes out terrible . actually , it 's almost funny in a way . the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . jinnie is a coun

Review: available for rental - october 12 , 1999 10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew .that said , drop any pre - conceived notions of what shakespeare 's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african - american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ;a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon - levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey 's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca 's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short .with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic - romance .yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comicalas when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage .the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca 's last name : stratford .their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman 's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly .in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family " no dating " policy is amended to " bianca can date .. .when [ katarina ] does ." with prom just ahead , bianca 's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew .do n't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister " ... is a particularly hideous breed of loser ." getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing .when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father 's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice .the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit " someone with money ." in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca .cameron 's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out .the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison .moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that " hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers ."the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet .providing a constant reminder of the fact that this is n't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy :a party polluted with liquor , a best friend 's betrayal , and prom .it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she 's all that , and ca n't hardly wait .yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .
