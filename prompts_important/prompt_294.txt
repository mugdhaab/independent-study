Review: starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .freeway is giving me second thoughts .freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul - mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) .to top that pathetic premise off-- reese goes to visit granny and you 'll never guess who 's waiting under the cover 's in granny 's bed .keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star .sowhat are they doing in this movie ?after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .the answer is quite simple --i do nt want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .note to keifer: you wonder why you are n't a bigger star in hollywood ? because you keep making movies like this .note to reese: you were great in fear , what happened this time ?note to both: do n't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway .bottom line --i 'm still shaking my head .do n't waste your time on this turkey . if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns .reese witherspoon 's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller .do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- butstay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .
