Review: accepting his oscar as producer of this year 's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . one could almost say the same about his much - prized film . rarely is the screenso overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling ,all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observationthat must somehow yield the truth . in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy fo

Review: capsule :the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . it continues the story of ripley , the space - trucker - turned - impromptu - survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all ,it 's so elegaic and limp . a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . the pri

Review: the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it 's only 80 minutes long and when it 's overyou 're glad that you did n't waste more than an hour and a half of your time.it 's nothing more than a bad rip - off of , " jaws" ( and i think that 's being kind . )it was written by david e .kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror - comedy butfails at both , miserably.i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once .the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda ."the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt )flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .there 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .as i mentioned before kelley and director steveminor ( h20 ) do n't go for a serious approach towards the material butthey also do n't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they 're all basically idiots .if they had any brains the croc would n't have been that much of a challenge to catchand they would n't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movie .basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
