Review: 50 's ` aliens vs . earth ' idea revamped ! if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50 's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens ' intention but soon finds out whe

Review: i have a great idea for a movie , one that ca n't miss . see , i 've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . it 's about professional basketball , so i 'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . as for what the movie is actually about .  .  . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . i figure it will be a comedy , so i 'll throw a half - dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . maybe we 'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decisi

Review: while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him . as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take - off .when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake .the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted .he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die .alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious " suicide " of a friend , and a mortician ( tony " candyman " todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death 's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims .in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death 's new plan and thwart it .of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the " scream " audience , " final destination " is the best so far .talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variationon a familiar formula .we 've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one - by - one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey - masked middle - man and makes the villain death itself .first - time feature director james wong made the most of that premise .every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime .everyday objects and events vibrate with menace .the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver 's " rocky mountain high , " which is played several times in the movie before someone dies .( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . ) the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror .devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , " idle hands , " gives a frantic and convincing lead performance .kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex 's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane .smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence .seann william scott , who 's also in theaters right now in " road trip , " plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter .tony todd 's one - scene cameo is delicious but all too brief .bottom line :watchableteen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting .
