Review: quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . john travolta made his come - back and is now one of today 's most bankable stars . bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she 's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert - written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . that is , until now . jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment .  despite excellent direction from tarantino ,the cast

Review: the catch phrase for disney 's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ), the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . "it was n't me !" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams ca n't take all the blame , but he sure ca n't justify himself with his own simple tag line either . fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide - eyed at a poster of the earth . as a 30-year - old , fred has n't grown up much , but at least he 's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void .  .  . fred . yes , althou

Review: in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg 's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas ' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .in january of this year , lucas re - released star wars on its 20th anniversary .in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer - generated jabba the hutt , do n't do much but call attention to themselves .other than these , the film is exactly the same .why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you have n't seen it .the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi - wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .he and kanoby then , joined by two inter - galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker 's two droids d2 and c3po( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .the film is obviously quite star - studded .but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones ' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?it just happened to work out for him .the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker 's triumph is symbolized by the audience 's sense of becoming something larger than life itself - a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . ,
