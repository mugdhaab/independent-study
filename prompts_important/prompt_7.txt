Review: " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien - like underwater sounds . then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams ' now infamous score . dah - dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams ' music . he 's buildi

Review: " quest for camelot " is warner bros .  'first feature - length , fully - animated attempt to steal clout from disney 's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall 's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney 's " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands - down when it came time to crown 1997 's best piece of animation . this year , it 's no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival . even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre-- that 'd be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- is n't nearly as dull as this . the story revolves around the adventures of free - spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early - teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur 's round table . kayley 's only dream is to follow in her father 's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber

Review: if you 've been following william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he 's played some rather similar roles over the years .like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .or colonel williamsharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny -- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard - hitting roles .which is why his performance in " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is such a shock , such a delight .in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog - loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner 's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .it borders on offensive but does n't really manage it .and it borders on clich ?d stereotype butdoes n't quite succumb to that definition either .in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal -- but he 's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devitoso how could that be possible ? )moviegoing experience .fichtner 's performance does n't exactly save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommending " what 's the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor 's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film 's rating from no stars to one - and - a - half .thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down -- way , way , down -- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movieso dull and pedestrian and nonsensicalit does n't even warrant discussion .
