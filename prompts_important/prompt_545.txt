Review: in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . in terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceedsher tender 14 years of age . she is one ?hot ' babe who defines true ? woman leadership ' . she not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . the young obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero .

Review: i 'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson 's work . he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . with teaching mrs . tingle ,his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to .  but where are the thrills ?the laughs ?both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . and what a shame that is . i loved the scream films- heck , i even enjoyed the sci - fi goofiness of the faculty . kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to wor

Review: the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .it 's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , butit does n't make a shred of sense .and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor .but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .at least we have chow yun - fat in the lead role .chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop .he 's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he 's very familiar with chinatown .that 's probably why the powers - that - be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .nick and danny begin by stepping on each other 's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one 's life .what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .i 'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .i 'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .i 'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , althoughthis makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .there 's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny 's father ( brian cox ) , but it does n't have much to do with the main story .one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie does n't make any sense .i do n't blame this entirely on foley , because he 's obviously a good director .i 'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci 's script , which does n't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .one scene early on had me particularly annoyed :nick confronts his boss because he 's angry about his new white partner .he 's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . )there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent.there 's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .the plot itself never straightens out .i 'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group .the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .the sequences are n't bad , but they 're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?one too many , i 'd imagine .foley 's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here .the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he 's still fun to watch .i also liked the subplot involving danny 's father ; brian cox 's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes .a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it 's over .the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of controluntil , finally , there 's nothing left to hold on to .
