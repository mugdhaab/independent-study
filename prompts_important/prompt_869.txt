Review: ` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles .as the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips .he pines for his ex - girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him .this film features good performances , impressive film - making technique and breath - taking crowd scenes .director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie .the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama .not that ambitious film - making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously .the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .
