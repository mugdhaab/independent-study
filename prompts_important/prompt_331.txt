Review: in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . each of the stories builds to a fast - paced climax . in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . this creates some strange effects . the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . the strands have varying de

Review: what are we going to do with jim carrey ?viewers of television 's " in living color " know this one - man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit - show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedyace ventura : pet detective . three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self - styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin . the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami . he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . he even does his captain kirk impersonation . again . all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutel

Review: a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche .a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche .at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche .complaining about cliches = cliche .ok , ok .so we always hear about cliches .but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie is n't a cut and paste example of everything we 've ever seen .they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90 's " .karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six - year stay at the state prison .she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six - year old son out there who does n't even know she 's alive .aware of mccoy 's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six - year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past .he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 + million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt .and if she refuses ? who knows what he 'll do to the kid .( cue sinister laughter )this movie is so pathetically pitifulthat it 's hard to know where to begin .the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .i ca n't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you 'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .basinger is absolutely vacant .and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?here 's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we 're supposed to feel sorry for her .as she confronts her son , who does n't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ?especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional - radiance whatsoever .i suppose i should mention val kilmer .yeah ,that 's right- he 's in it !quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .and he got second billing !to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j .t . barker .unfortunately the script does n't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .the real mccoyjust ca n't keep it's head above water,and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie .the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt 's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra .this is definitely one to avoid , folks .the real mccoy is anything but !
