Review: there have been bad films in recent years : ' mr . magoo ' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad ' blue in the face ' , the horrible ' baby genuises ' and now ' i woke up early the day i died ' . it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . the film 's acting ( if that 's what you want to call it ) iswell mediocre to me . loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . after escaping from a mental institution ' the thief ' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . a country - wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . now he is determi

Review: the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany 's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook - yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable andshe is quite resistible .alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we 're fuck buddies . " )but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee 's inability to decide what she wants to be saying .she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .alessa is looking for financial securitybut she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .this appears to be a high profile and well - paid job .we are supposed to care about alessa 's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .alessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double - zero.i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
