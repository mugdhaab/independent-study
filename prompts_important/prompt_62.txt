Review: you 've heard all the hype . you 've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler 's list ) as qui - gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi - wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . if you 've read any reviews , you 've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . you also may have heard that this one 's too kiddie - friendly , and does n't have enough content for adults . believe the hype . the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic ,the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala 's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . but there 's something missing here , and it is n't budget or effects- it 's everything money* ca n't * buy . the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad - stroked and flat characters . the most successful at this is liam neeson w

Review: die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film 's pathetic screenplay .every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs .so much for the script .how about the action ?well , let 's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator --all standouts for their hair - raising suspense .by contrast , harlin does n't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so badit 's good .you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .
