Review: in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . in other words , it 's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson 's greatest hits , payback probably wo n't be on it . gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . mel 's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . but , mel is n't dead( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly is n't happy . to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . payback is often a very violent film .  to its credit, there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , b

Review: the u .  s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . one particular field manual is known as the fm 22 - 5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . under the " saluting " section is a sub - section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . the salute is rendered by the highest - ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . almost at the very beginning of the general 's daughter , we see a general 's motorcade passing a work detail . everyone salutes . it looked impressive , but it just was n't right . that little bit showed me that someone either did n't do the appropriate

Review: the question is n't why has grease been reissued .the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie 's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount 's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?the answer is not an easy one .grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the ' 50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high - spirited.travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non - threatening .but grease did n't break any new cinematic ground .it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .what grease is - or has become - is the highest - grossing musical in film history .ok , let 's not be a spoilsport .grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton - john , taxi 's jeff conaway and the multi - talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .it 's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it 's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .between grease and 1996 's evita ., you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .today 's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .secondly , a lack of talent .performers with the charisma , the style , the larger - than - life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re - release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .perhaps not original musicals such as singin ' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber 's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .let grease be the word that sparks this revival .
