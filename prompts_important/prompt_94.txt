Review: instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . i have a name for it myself : " gross " . this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : are n't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ?this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience 's intelligence . instinct 's plot is brimming with potential : world - renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . after com

Review: "the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we 've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) , man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) .now , " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears .the story , if that 's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king 's wife and is banished from his home land .he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them .eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men .thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth .he 's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he 'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield .that 's basically the entire plot .there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers did n't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story .instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer .the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a storyit becomes a laughing stock .the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting .we do n't get to know any of the charactersand so we do n't care who lives and who dies .the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action - adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels .it was directed by john mctiernan who 's , " the thomas crown affair " is also playing in theaters currently .and it 's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , " the 13th warrior " was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences .it belongs back on the shelf .
