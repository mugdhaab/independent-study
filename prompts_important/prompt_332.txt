Review: there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it 's just that none of them happen to be actors . the stars i 'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie 's " outer space " ;the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . yes , in terms of acting , the star power is .  .  . well, more like a falling star . kinda pretty , short - lived , and pretty much dead .  lost in space , as if you really did n't know , is based on the 60 's sci - fi television series of the same name . it 's the year 2058 , and earth 's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . earth 's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john 's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their hom

Review: contact is the 1997 movie i 've seen the most - five times to be exact . four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv ,it 's a very impressive film . the same ca n't be said for films like independance day , but that 's because contact is a rare example in sci - fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 did n't offer much outside of some one - time delightful eye candy . contact 's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of " merely listening " to sounds out in space . her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat roo

Review: a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche .a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche .at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche .complaining about cliches = cliche .ok , ok .so we always hear about cliches .but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie is n't a cut and paste example of everything we 've ever seen .they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90 's " .karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six - year stay at the state prison .she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six - year old son out there who does n't even know she 's alive .aware of mccoy 's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six - year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past .he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 + million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt .and if she refuses ? who knows what he 'll do to the kid .( cue sinister laughter )this movie is so pathetically pitifulthat it 's hard to know where to begin .the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .i ca n't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you 'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .basinger is absolutely vacant .and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?here 's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we 're supposed to feel sorry for her .as she confronts her son , who does n't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ?especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional - radiance whatsoever .i suppose i should mention val kilmer .yeah ,that 's right- he 's in it !quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .and he got second billing !to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j .t . barker .unfortunately the script does n't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .the real mccoyjust ca n't keep it's head above water,and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie .the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt 's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra .this is definitely one to avoid , folks .the real mccoy is anything but !
