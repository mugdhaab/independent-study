Review: "it 's not good to know too much about someone , charlie , " charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her " soul mate " as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . there 's a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt .  and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . john gay 's script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . karen arthur 's direction is certainly no match for the gre

Review: deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review : this is what feel - good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 's : an hour - and - a - half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film .  ) as the absent - minded professor who invents the titular computer - generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly - founded but firm belief that writer / producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instrume

Review: in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison .after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel .fortunately , for audience members there 's a chance to escape the nearest exit .this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy 's worst movie and that 's an accomplishment .remember the golden child , harlem nights ?compared to life , they look like citizen kane .life is long , predictable , foul - mouthed and only intermittently funny .its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years .robert ramsey and matthew stone 's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as " motherf . . .s " or " n . . . . .s ."you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used .and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie .but , like life , it will probably stink .to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up .but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well .life is as sophisticated as a belch .it 's crude and stereotypical .years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second - class people , good for being only maids and servants .for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved .but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies .in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast - talking , conniving , scam artists or hip - hop , gun - crazy , sex - crazed youths .both sets of caricatures are demeaning .and the fault does not rest with the actors .they have to eat , too .it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green - light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest .life 's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds .otherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it .see it at your own risk .
