Review: roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . but benigni 's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni 's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost - forgotten harry langdon , benigni 's guido has a childlike innocence . he ignores the growing anti - semitism of the fascist government . instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . in

Review: so , it 's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . that might have been an exciting notion if it was n't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993 's " grumpy old men , " 1995 's " grumpier old men , " and 1997 's " out to sea" ( i . e . "grumpiest old men " ) . so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e . "the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series . the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau 's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . oscar 's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix 's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .  .  . then hilarity ensues . well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . neil simon , the award - winning playwright who creat

Review: a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche .a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche .at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche .complaining about cliches = cliche .ok , ok .so we always hear about cliches .but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie is n't a cut and paste example of everything we 've ever seen .they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90 's " .karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six - year stay at the state prison .she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six - year old son out there who does n't even know she 's alive .aware of mccoy 's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six - year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past .he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 + million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt .and if she refuses ? who knows what he 'll do to the kid .( cue sinister laughter )this movie is so pathetically pitifulthat it 's hard to know where to begin .the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .i ca n't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you 'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .basinger is absolutely vacant .and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?here 's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we 're supposed to feel sorry for her .as she confronts her son , who does n't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ?especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional - radiance whatsoever .i suppose i should mention val kilmer .yeah ,that 's right- he 's in it !quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .and he got second billing !to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j .t . barker .unfortunately the script does n't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .the real mccoyjust ca n't keep it's head above water,and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie .the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt 's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra .this is definitely one to avoid , folks .the real mccoy is anything but !
