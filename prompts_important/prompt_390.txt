Review: one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb 's runaway hit dawson 's creek . following in the foot steps of mtv 's two other live action films , joe 's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) . we know he 's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . also on the team are an enormous

Review: there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full - circle . for fans of both genres , however , realism is key . action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie 's end . on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that 's fallen into the same category over the last few years . the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big - screen debut, approaches levels of complexityth
Important Phrases: ['the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing', 'approaches levels of complexity', 'afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times', 'masters the script with poise', 'his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here', 'the most outstanding of his in quite some time', 'takes command and offers much gravity', 'the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews', 'another good bet', 'turned out well', 'definitely worth the visit']

Review: burnt money is the perfect festival film .it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again .this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 's emerging masters series is easily one of the year 's worst.billed as a gay ` bonnie and clyde ' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ?eyro has its only highlight in a well - designed title sequence .two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry .this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . hiding out in a prostitute 's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie 's conclusion .if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love .as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying .or something like that .everything that happens is so quick and confusingi was completely lost .clarity is n't exactly this movie 's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up .not much could have really happened though .the main events in this long two - hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language .lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there 's a reason , but there 's no purpose to anything in this film .most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing .it appears pi ?eyro ( who co - wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement .he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go .burnt money is pointless .the performances are bad .it tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom.god forbid it will ever get a distributor .another disappointing film from this year 's so - called emerging masters series .pass on by .
