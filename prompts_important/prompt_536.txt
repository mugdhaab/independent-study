Review: as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . with a total of 4 decent films , it 's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be . the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . so far it sounds interesting right ?not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . after that , they basically run around killing . that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . obviously that 's not the case here . even
Important Phrases: ['you will be disappointed', 'it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work', 'they failed to deliver that as well', 'corny dialogue', "a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there 's basically nothing to like here", "the film could n't be saved", 'you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself', 'save your money']

Review: the happy bastard 's quick movie review analyze this how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ?well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send - up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! failed to really get the joke . this time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targetsmore than it misses . .  . and for plenty of reasons . the story goes like this . a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near - death following a drive - by shooting . it 's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who 's mostly reluctant to take the mobster 's case for two reasons . first , of course , he 's a mobster , but secondly , he 's trying to get married and enjoy

Review: how could a g - rated disney film based on meg cabot 's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ?easy .take all the cute , harmless fun out of it .and while you 're at it make it borrr - ring .that 's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g - rated disney film " the princess diaries ."you could n't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass .of growing , glowing pre - pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy - duddy old me ) .well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious .too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall 's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride" --but this one 's way without julia robertsso maybe*that 's * its problem ) .in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it( it 's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we have n't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) .marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he 's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two is n't working . . .and hardly* any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there 's none of that here either ) .newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way* not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all minisculeeuropean countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones / tiara combo in the print ads ) .julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia 's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia 's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ?not really .consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets .also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky - looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic / musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia 's chauffeur - driven limousine at every intersection .a non - animated g - rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product .lame , labored , and lamentable, " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight - and - a - half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) .
