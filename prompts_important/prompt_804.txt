Review: in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . sir anthony hopkins , playing a super - rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . whichever one you like , dear , he says . and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . i liked that scene for two reasons . first , the cakes looked really cool . second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to a

Review: in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . the cop in question can not solve the case until he gets in trouble . all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . the duo must always be completely mismatched . the hero has to say some smart - assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . however , that does n't necessarily make for a bad film . rush hour is jackie chan 's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . still , some die - hardjackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . jackie chan i

Review: you 'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .that 's a bit more difficult .the farfetched sci - fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .if you 're not nice to it , you lose .galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks 's spaceballs was to star wars ,an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean - spirited or malintentioned ."the show 's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over ."that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that 's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show 's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .jason nesmith( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .dane , who played a spock - like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character 's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar 's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die - hard fans .one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers .they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film 's only mean - spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .of course , they all think he is out of his mindand once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .taking shots at both the obvious and not - so - obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub 's fred a .k .a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " ,chen 's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , wo n't take it or something ." it 's a hoot , but it does n't stop there :weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier - than - thou attitude are n't far behind .galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it 's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments --it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .by grabthar 's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .
