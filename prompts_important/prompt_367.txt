Review: the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what is n't , and if our world is just a huge game . the thirteenth floor does n't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i did n't expect it to take , and i 'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make .  rather than focusing ju

Review: a big house . a big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame . a big star , catherine zeta - jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6 .  5/10 ) and zorro . a big remake of the haunting .  and big special effects . so what do they all amount to ?unfortunately for us , a big bore ! plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing . unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear . critique : this movie just did n't scare me one bit. sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole ,it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children 's voices and over - the - top special effects , to scare us . well , this film did n't do much for me . and they might as well have called it the " haunting of

Review: it 's a shamethe execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there 's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .not that there 's anything wrong with scatology .i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .it 's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .adults ?well , let 's just say most will find it unappetizing.osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .frank 's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .it 's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate 's mouth .like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier 's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?s of that genre .and this is why osmosis jones does n't click .it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .the jokes and puns are lame: osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he does n't look fluish ."and the jokes do n't rise above that level .the live action scenes are no better .frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .he 's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat .it lacks scope and depth .it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
