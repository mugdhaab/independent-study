Review: i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . i 've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . breakdown , then , is something of a surprise . russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay wi

Review: i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .i 'm big fan of perry 's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley 's on - edge , extreme acting was a riot .so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley 's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry 's big breakthrough .i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley 's best , in spite of david spade 's absence .i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .sadly , none of this came to pass .the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one - liners few and far between .perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it 's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it 's a farley flick .the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .and farley 's classic humor is widespread , too .almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot .guys , let 's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?stick to " tommy boy " , and we 'll all be " friends " .
