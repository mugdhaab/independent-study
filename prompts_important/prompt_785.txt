Review: the first thing you notice about this movie is that it 's cold . placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow - covered ground against a background of white . just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . even more remarkably , it works . the only likable person in the film is

Review: i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner , and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less - than - subtle presence . this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor , but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . although gere 's performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect , and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . this is where

Review: mars attacks !( 1996 )- c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones .this is director tim burton 's finest film to date .many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films .however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 .you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film .it is completely wacked - out and unlike anything you 've ever seen .once the silly tone of the film is set , it 's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do n't mix .the plot is simple : martians invade the earth .but it 's different than any other invasion film .usually it 's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans .this time however , it 's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans .the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i 've seen in a long time.they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious .and about the special effects .the effects in mars attacks ! are just about the most flawless ones i 've seen to date .the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 % real .there are just a couple of scenes that do n't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship .also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise .but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .could it have been funnier ?certainly . was it funny enough ?yes .was i entertained ? absolutely .on a personal note , i 'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war - crazy general decker .finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see .while he 's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in ,he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue .the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him .
