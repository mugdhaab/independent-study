Review: when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit ,i thought it looked kind of lame . and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad. but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened . it got great reviews . critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead - on parody of mob movies " . well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be goodand so i headed off to the theater . you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for . " analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted . do n't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here . i think the problem is he did n't quite know how to approach this material . he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere i

Review: the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor 's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . and so , after a six - year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . williams is the title character , hunter " patch " adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean - shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . we 're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . it 's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to

Review: starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .freeway is giving me second thoughts .freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul - mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) .to top that pathetic premise off-- reese goes to visit granny and you 'll never guess who 's waiting under the cover 's in granny 's bed .keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star .sowhat are they doing in this movie ?after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .the answer is quite simple --i do nt want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .note to keifer: you wonder why you are n't a bigger star in hollywood ? because you keep making movies like this .note to reese: you were great in fear , what happened this time ?note to both: do n't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway .bottom line --i 'm still shaking my head .do n't waste your time on this turkey . if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns .reese witherspoon 's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller .do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- butstay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .
