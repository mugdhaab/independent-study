Review: scream 2 is n't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . and , while there 's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . scream 2 is a slice - and - dice movie for those who do n't take their horror too seriously . the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $ 100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actor

Review: an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis ' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit - coms . where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny. in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached ,
Important Phrases: ['a failed attempt', 'has the kind of revolting silliness', 'this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny', 'an otherwise classless production', 'the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below', 'it would be kind to call him bland', "it 's all bad news", 'then becomes tedious', 'clash violently']

Review: synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves .meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?it 's hard to speculate .most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar .in case you have n't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom - of - the - barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .there 's really not much to say .the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist 's agent .he is so horrible in this role that one ca n't help but be amused .the plot sucks .nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .the dialogue stinks .a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really does n't need to know .everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits .as the names of the not - so - talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist ."someone could have used an editor !to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here .i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie .why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i 'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
