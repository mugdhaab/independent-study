Review: i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) , except if you 're child ?in which case it would be called experimenting .rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . hardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed .despite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over .well , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life .and it 's sweet .drew barrymore who shone in ?ever after ' is wonderful as ?josie , grossy ' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter .it addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting .hard to believe , but possible .there may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss .so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it .either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending .
