Review: there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . two is never greenlight a sci - fi film starring john travolta . to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . a science - fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum - security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . sci - fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . battlefield earthfails at achieving even one of these attributes . here 's the ` plot .  'the year is 3000 . mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . a small band of h

Review: why do so many children 's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? too many of those who write or direct for children 's movies assume that the kids just ca n't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . "the iron giant , " which was directed and co - written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . "the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that 's enjoyable for both children and adults alike. hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard - working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen hi

Review: ok , i admit it -- i find camp amusement with the spice girls .yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities , " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power ."but not even their guilty pleasure appeal is n't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world .the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- " scary " ( melanie brown ) , " baby " ( emma bunton ) , " sporty " ( melanie chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwell ) , and " posh " ( victoria adams )--are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) .a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london 's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls ' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) .capped off by a live rendition of the girls ' bouncy hit " say you 'll be there , " a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? wrong .it 's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches .i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and directorbob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the " wacky " goings - on .spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride .while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there -- during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric" we know how we got this far / strength and courage and a wonderbra" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level .some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore 's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor - heavy advice to clifford .the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond .ha ha .as weak as the script is , i think there 's one insurmountable problemwith even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves .the point is not that they ca n't act ( and , for the record , they really _ ca n't _ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four - minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world .posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film .baby 's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls ' identities are a little harder to flesh out .there really is n't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _ exactly _ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being " ginger " or " scary " ?apparently , just their wardrobes .spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices ' signature hit , " wannabe ." the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much - needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self - referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters ' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman 's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) .this section of the film , involving all manner of derring - do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff .spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful .but this sloppy enterprise surely wo n't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states .once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices ' final hurrah in america .
