Review: i 've noticed something lately that i 've never thought of before . pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ?more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . i 'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the tim

Review: janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy-- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . this is a by - the - books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . it also jumps on the ever - popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too. garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that 's made the kennedy family so popular . so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this . the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong-- garofalo has to take

Review: for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects .but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer - director , the audience is left in the dark .the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him .he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars .then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five - year - old daughter .raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie 's brother , billy ( charlie creed - miles ) , of stealing .raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite )him to a bloody wreck .but these are the least of billy 's problems .billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it does n't seem that he 'll last much longer .billy and valerie 's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond 's nemesis .she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it .she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments .if this description seems bleak , i have n't told the half of it .this is not a cheery movie , and most of the timeit 's downright depressing .while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end ,it 's not quite worth it .there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose .take for example the extended sequence where one of billy 's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy .the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything .granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us .the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles .the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into .the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there 's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices .a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience .oldman got it about half right .
