Review: "the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it 's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually , if you 've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . but he 's afflicted with loser - itis . dogs attack him, neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him . truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we 'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . this is actually bad because you ca n't like a character if you ca n't develop sympathy for him . we never do ,
Important Phrases: ['however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn', 'equally tenuous', "this element does n't work the first time it 's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence", "it 's too bad that she 's in such a mediocre offering"]

Review: has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot - driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 's lame brained men in black .will this guy ever get a real role ?he has the bruce willis syndrome .the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . .you know .enemy was one of the worst films of last year .not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight ,the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i did n't like how smith always magically out - smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .somehow , quality ca n't overshadow quantity .
