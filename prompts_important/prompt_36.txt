Review: the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film 's end . if you 're not familiar with this law , then maybe you 've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film 's end . now if you 're a regular reader of mine , you 've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ?no , it definitely is not . melissa joan hart ( from abc 's " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who 's just broken up with his activist girlfriend . apparently he wants to make his ex - girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends

Review: having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .  aside from the fact that it 's a milestone in animation in movies ( it 's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters ,have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainmentit 's also quite an effective comedy / mystery . while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . the story begins in hollywood in 1947 . cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard - boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger 's mind back on work . maroon thinks that roger 's wife , jessica 's , possible unfaithfulness

Review: in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .was it " deep " ?nope .however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .which was true .if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ;mr . lovell gave it** * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be ." ; mr .travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .i admire mr .burton for trying to do more then entertain , butthe result is a mess .nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .alas, these are only hints .there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .
