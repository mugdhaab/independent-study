Review: we 're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo 's vision of a william gibson - inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for .front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber - courier " who smuggles data via a " wet - wired " implant .he 's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long - term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . .the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed .he 's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice - t , and dina meyer .( dolph lundgren 's street preacher is in an acting category all its own .: - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places .the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx -- such as miniatures and mattes -- leave a lot to be desired .watch out for those bad blue - screens !we would n't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better .too bad the debut director is n't very strong in this de- partment .his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down .bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . skip it .
