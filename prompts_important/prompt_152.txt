Review: there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god 's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . it 's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . it turns out that he 's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido - versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . no .  .  .  not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . it 's the environmental protection agency . i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !taggert is sent 
Important Phrases: this piece of toxic waste, the worst offering that has hit the screen, looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role, slow and plodding , this project is a total mess, quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever, the most annoying moment, the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets, nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal 's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance, poorly developed vehicles

Review: being the self - proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently .after all , it 's considered by just about everyone to bethe masterpiece epic ofdirector david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago .so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it .i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt - numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration .but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against --the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound .after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen .based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t .e . lawrence during world wari , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then - unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever .bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re - assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army .lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world wari . shot in panavision 's famed super 70 mm format , the film beautifullyillustrates the definition of the word epic .it is absolutely breathtaking . using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes .every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land .david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today .after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i 've got to do a remake of this film !"but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern - day movie executive : " okay , it 's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert .we are going to need to blow up a full - size train because computer - generated effects probably wo nt do it justice .and we are not going to use any big stars , and wo n't have any female actors since there 's no love story ."yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden - era of hollywood a long time ago .but at least we still have the proof to show all would - be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .
