Review: in " the astronaut 's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie - hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly . if only her name was n't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci - fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary 's species . " what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar - worthy in " the devil 's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip - off of a screendom classic in recent memory . ok , maybe " the astronaut 's wife " deviates from " rosemary 's baby " turf for its set - up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan 's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man . predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . "theron 's " ad

Review: i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .i 'm big fan of perry 's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley 's on - edge , extreme acting was a riot .so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley 's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry 's big breakthrough .i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley 's best , in spite of david spade 's absence .i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .sadly , none of this came to pass .the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one - liners few and far between .perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it 's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it 's a farley flick .the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .and farley 's classic humor is widespread , too .almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot .guys , let 's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?stick to " tommy boy " , and we 'll all be " friends " .
