Review: mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial - arts violence .  )with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it 's just about time . for over twenty - five years , jackie 's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . i 'm not entirely sure why , exactly . in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie 's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others . in fact , looking at all thes

Review: for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer does n't change a thing , since body of evidence was n't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas - ish presence all over it . in other words , it 's a ) really dirty and b )really , really stupid . madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi - naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . she 's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie can not be sexual unless she 's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . what 's w

Review: bats is this year 's camp flick .with the world 's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity .as for the rest of us , well . . .i 'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway .follow their lead and you 'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot .i love alfred hitchcock 's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based .it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror / schlock such as bats .when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate .it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious .why has he done this , you ask ?because , you see , it is apparently a scientist 's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind .so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world .of course , that ca n't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture .consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave .the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out .what do they do ?do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ?nope .they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes .what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes .we do n't even get to see what 's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick .all we know is that bats are attacking .how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery .a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some .of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it does n't really go anywhere.most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist 's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats !" some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept .i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one - liners .playing such characters does not help actors ' careers .still , i suppose that if you 're looking for a movie that is " so badit 's good , " you could do worse than bats .it does have a tremendous amount of camp value .i 'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly ,it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .more power to them .
