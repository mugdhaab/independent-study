Review: the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor 's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . and so , after a six - year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . williams is the title character , hunter " patch " adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean - shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . we 're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . it 's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to

Review: meet joe black is your classic boy - meets - girl , boy - likes - girl , boy - gets - killed - in - horrible - accident , supernatural - entity - takes - over - boy's - body , supernatural - entity - falls - in - love - with - girl story .based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love .william parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday .he has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani ) .william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots . . .but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he wo n't be able to talk his way out of .and he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him .however , death has a deal to make .death has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living .in return , william gets to live a few extra days .of course , he agrees .death , under the human name of " joe black " , gets to experience life as a complete innocent .he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter .and he 's not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love .but , is their affair doomed to an early demise ?at nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy .instead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations .you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it .the romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter .this is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills .william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and does n't want to let it go .by contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest .she gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character .as joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted .granted , he 's supposed to be out - of - place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role .still , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you .the main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams ' company who is joe black 's main rival for susan 's affections .weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash .this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters .the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so .we never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he 's never done something like this before .it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices / accents .( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) and the ultimate resolution to one of the film 's supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial .still , even with the film 's length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you would n't necessarily expect from a film about death . . .but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .
