Review: the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . but after diasappointing films such as " godzilla " and " fear and loathing in las vegas " , it would be nice to see a really good film . but i doubt you could have expected this . the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the " decade 's best " list . there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim ," yes , that 's what makes this film great . "the blend of peter weir 's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou 's stunning photography and jim carrey 's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically. there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . carrey has made a very wise choice . by playing mild - mannered truman burbank , he allows himself eno

Review: if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell 's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo - smashing excesses of the disco era 's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . so when miramax started production on _ 54 _ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down - and - dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first - timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , andmike myers in his dramatic debut ) . my , how easily does the worm turn . hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th - hour reshoots( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio - imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher )unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not sc

Review: a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attemptat romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge .at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic -- and , yes , ordinary -- premise .after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville 's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .the joke here is that celine is a willing victim -- her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge -- and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . ..and , ultimately ( did n't we see this one coming ? ) , love .so far , so mediocre .but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is, thanks in no small part to the hodge 's contextual frame for the romance .it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven 's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert -- or lose their angel status .this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .not that there is much of a romance to begin with .try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one - note to become very endearing characters .celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two -- then again ,they never seem to really connect with each other .when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .but i am not exactly sureif boyle and company 's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that -- energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting .the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic-- in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar .after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary ."i can accept failure .everyone fails at something .but i ca n't accept not trying .it does n't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart ."--michael jordan
