Review: all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre - release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante 's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . no number of name changes can help this picture . it 's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud - choked skies . from that moment on , it 's

Review: at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that 's true of home alone2and i 'd bet money that it 's true of home alone3 ( opening soon ) . but home aloneactually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick does n't get in the way . the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids ' cruelty . kevin 's patience runs out when he learns that his plain - cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he 's going to have to starve . he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . the fight disrupts the already - chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . the knee - jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . nobody came to his rescue when he

Review: "the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we 've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) , man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) .now , " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears .the story , if that 's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king 's wife and is banished from his home land .he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them .eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men .thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth .he 's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he 'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield .that 's basically the entire plot .there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers did n't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story .instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer .the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a storyit becomes a laughing stock .the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting .we do n't get to know any of the charactersand so we do n't care who lives and who dies .the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action - adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels .it was directed by john mctiernan who 's , " the thomas crown affair " is also playing in theaters currently .and it 's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , " the 13th warrior " was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences .it belongs back on the shelf .
