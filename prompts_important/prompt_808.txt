Review: can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ?i think not , but that 's what children of the corn 666 : issac 's return wants us to believe . the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date. unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary . the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday . what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder . that 's about all that 's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children

Review: in my review of there 's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter is n't everything ."i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter is n't everything , unless i 'm watching a jim abrahams film .see , spoofs are easy with me .i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .sometimes i 'm the only one in the theater laughing .sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high - pitched in comparison to my speaking voice( it cuts right through everyone else 's laughter ) .sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .abraham 's latest film , mafia !, induced this kind of hysteria upon me .it 's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i 'm the guy who laughs at everything .there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought - provoking .most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .mafia !has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . to describe the story of mafia ! is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !to his experience .he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .he looks like he 's having so much fun that he 's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .he 's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando 's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead - on in a full - blown mockery of sharon stone .the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i 'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! that i ca n't remember a lot of what made me laugh .but that 's a good sign : mafia !is so funny that i was n't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain.i know that does n't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .finally , a film that does this for me .
