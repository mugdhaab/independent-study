Review: warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it . while i do n't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . but , in a nutshell , it 's a good film . star wars episode i :the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace . however , it ca n't be ignored . endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi - billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations . thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better . while the " first " star wars trilogy

Review: lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically - acclaimed films as " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " a clockwork orange , " " lolita , " and " dr .  strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb .  " now , sadly , he 's added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near - flawless copybook . kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead . this much - publicized psycho - sexual tease - a - thon , with its star billing of real - life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two - and - a - half hours long ) boring exercisethat features kubrick operating with talentwide shut . kubrick , faithlessto arthur schnitzler 's 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity . he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly . he has confused profundity with pretentiousness . in addition

Review: razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .official release : halloween reviewed by vince yim` you think you know all about vampires . . .believe me . . .you know f* ck all . 'with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .so , what 's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?with that out of the way , let me say this .this film is bad .this film is really , really bad .yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ?buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ?any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . period .razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , does n't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the ` opium of the peoples ' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .but aside from that , it does n't stray too far away from horror film conventions .that is , unless that is intentional .razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .you ca n't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .you 'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .you 'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .and then , there 's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin - tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you 've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .but in case you really care , she 's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so - called illuminati , and she 's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .almost destined for cult - status , the film 's campy , cheesy overtonesactually work towards the film .while this may not necessarily be the film you 'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .
