Review: a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african - american . an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho 's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . it 's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . this sleazy pic , soon became grating a

Review: as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragoni thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film. with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa . attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half - gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to

Review: the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it 's only 80 minutes long and when it 's overyou 're glad that you did n't waste more than an hour and a half of your time.it 's nothing more than a bad rip - off of , " jaws" ( and i think that 's being kind . )it was written by david e .kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror - comedy butfails at both , miserably.i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once .the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda ."the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt )flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .there 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .as i mentioned before kelley and director steveminor ( h20 ) do n't go for a serious approach towards the material butthey also do n't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they 're all basically idiots .if they had any brains the croc would n't have been that much of a challenge to catchand they would n't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movie .basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
