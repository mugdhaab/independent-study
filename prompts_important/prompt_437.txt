"- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo - pseudo - pseudo - character development .by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i do n't know , the " outer limits " or something .the script 's terrible .the special effects are okay , but nothing great .the story 's so weak that it 's almost opaque.the whole experience just is n't worth it unless you 're so bored that you 'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . .or this .i 'd pick this , obviously , but still ,it 's just not fun at all .and i ca n't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
