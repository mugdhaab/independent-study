Review: wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation - induced mutation . the " original " inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that 's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . there 's a lot you can

Review: leonardo decaprio ( what 's eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv 's my so called life )star in director baz luhrmann 's modernized version of william shakespeare 's classic , romeo & juliet . surrounded by a superb supporting cast , in - cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus - pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danesshine throughout the film . the story starts off at a gas station , where the " montague boys " meet the " capulet boys " and square off with one another . symbolizing the swords of shakespeare 's day were their weapons , like the " rapier-9 mm " or the " longsword- shotgun . " instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo 's best friend . mercutio , who in shakespeare 's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri - can - ame

Review: synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves .meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?it 's hard to speculate .most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar .in case you have n't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom - of - the - barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .there 's really not much to say .the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist 's agent .he is so horrible in this role that one ca n't help but be amused .the plot sucks .nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .the dialogue stinks .a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really does n't need to know .everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits .as the names of the not - so - talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist ."someone could have used an editor !to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here .i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie .why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i 'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
