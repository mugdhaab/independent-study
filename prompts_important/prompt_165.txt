Review: in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . each of the stories builds to a fast - paced climax . in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . this creates some strange effects . the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . the strands have varying de

Review: what are we going to do with jim carrey ?viewers of television 's " in living color " know this one - man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit - show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedyace ventura : pet detective . three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self - styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin . the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami . he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . he even does his captain kirk impersonation . again . all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutel

Review: every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise .i do n't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i 'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence .usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo .it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly .that 's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .what 's more , it 's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp - witted lesson in english social history .princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good - hearted gentlewoman mrs .worrall ( wendy hughes ) .her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none - too - pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr .worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs .worrall .however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr .worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs .worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co - writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light - hearted to be heavy - handed .he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a " sensation " at court .in one of the film 's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .the performers are mostly delightful, particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs .worrall; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls ' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world - weary but ultimately romantic gutch .only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess 's identity .the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo is n't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out .it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding -- a hidden gem .
