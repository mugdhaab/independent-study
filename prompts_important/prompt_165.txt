Review: a big surprise to me . the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . they replaced him just fine . not with john goodman , he did n't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who 's ten . this was another of my fears for the film , but he 's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica( although he may have been dubbed ) . things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . i 'm quite pleased that there were less car pile - ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . there 's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile - up , but after that it all stops . it 's just the music . one

Review: edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working - class relationship picture . however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . she 's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she 's going nowhere . her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . if she were to marry him , she 'd never get a chance to escape this town . enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia 's old flame . he skipped town several years before , without any explanations .  .  . even for claudia . he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown .  .  . or should she igno

Review: toward the bottom of the ' 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .this carl " apollo creed" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs .evil establishment crook , and relies on all the ' 80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , " you tore his arm off !" jackson replies , " he had a spare ."jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take ityou 're not one of dellaplane 's friends . "" not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .and of course it turns out stone is mrs .dellaplane .faux pas , jackson . ..not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .it 's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane 's nightclub .after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation ."he responds , " you 're getting one , " and it 's damn clever because he 's sitting down at the time .prince would n't even let out an innuendo that lameand he 's the king of the horndogs .. .or at least the prince .it 's a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they 're given , there 's not much room for improvement .my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone 's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head ."jackson 's response is , " i think i felt that way once .they called it love ."you 'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !
