"a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of " delicatessen , " or " the tin drum . " imagine all of that , and you 'll get a good sense of what you can expect from " the butcher boy . " imagine that and more . neil jordan 's latest film " stars " rea in more ways than one . rea ,the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan 's " the crying game ," contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s . but it 's his wall - to - wall narration as the butcher boy of the title, da brady 's son , f

Review: it rocks - actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land - once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences - they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur .  )they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user 's answer to deep impact . bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil - driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . why an oil driller ?they require someone experience with deep - core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .

Review: it 's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of " award - winning " tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes .that said , hayes 's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic .but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary .those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film 's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno - deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over - protective , hyper religious , reagan - loving mother .gyllenhall 's sweet - natured delivery of jimmy 's hilariously na ?ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming - of - age story :jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld .his mom home - schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti - sexual messages , until he 's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door .jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss .but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks - addled cross - country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love .the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy 's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film 's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center onoutrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi .but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it 's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags .they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks .but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send - up of a cult called " bright ' nshiny , " led by the inimitable fabio . unfortunately ,a few giggles ca n't make bubble boy the riotous , off - the - wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . honestly ,it 's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i 'm not just saying that because it 's so mediocre . how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that does n't seem to appeal to any particular demographic andhas the potential to offend so many .and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real - life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney 's wondering the same thing .hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .
