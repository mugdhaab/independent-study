Review: " houston . we have a serious problem . " after making " mission : impossible " , brian de palma has a lot to live up to . by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience . and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster . starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from " apollo 13 " , de palma slowly builds up his " story " . the human race has already set foot on mars . a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened . this is basically the whole plot . so it 's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours . but de palma manages to do that . it is not a very good achievement . as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake . the film 's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is . david mamet 's dialogue ,

Review: part one of " the strangest movies ever made " series at www . mediajunkies . com by scott watson [ light spoilers , nothing you should n't read ]existenz has been called " a gooey matrix " , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , " real " reality . a major difference is that " the matrix " has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . and oh what a reality it is . david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . maybe it 's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . technology is organic , but only some of it . cars are normal . gas stations are the same . cell phones are glowing bug like appendages . you
Important Phrases: ["that 's the true joy", 'a fantastic scene', 'will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards', 'a supremely far out trip']

Review: vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors .this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows .it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they would n't bother to write any jokes into the script .at least that 's the way it looks when watching this turkey .about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point .by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags .i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in .they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film 's best moments .every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .which brings me to the best moment of the film .the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . too bad .
