Review: written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . the novel was a summer smash , topping best - seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . the only problem : the novel was n't very good . it was far more pulp than pulitzer . but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . the director ?francis ford coppola . the book , of course , was mario puzo 's the godfather . the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . by bringing up the godfather , i do n't mean to suggest that robert altman 's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness

Review: it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . both those films were tense exercises in chills . the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . the thrills all came from the plot . ronin is like a film made by another man . somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . we get a clue here and one there as to what is going onbut j . d . zeik 's screenplay is a bit obscure . the
Important Phrases: ['a bit obscure', 'unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care']

Review: the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany 's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook - yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable andshe is quite resistible .alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we 're fuck buddies . " )but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee 's inability to decide what she wants to be saying .she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .alessa is looking for financial securitybut she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .this appears to be a high profile and well - paid job .we are supposed to care about alessa 's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .alessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double - zero.i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
