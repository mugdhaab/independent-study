Review: plot : good ol' texan kid suddenly gets to play first - string quarterback on his high school team 's football team , in a town where football is considered religion . the coach is just about the biggest a - hole you 'd ever want to meet , who will do practically anything to win . the good ol' texan boy does not approve of said man 's methods . critique :a fun football movie . this film was obviously geared towards the teen market , with mtv behind its production , a big tv star actor in the lead role , rockin ' hip music galore , and plenty of t&a . having said that , i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie, thought james van der beek gave a solid performance , loved the slick sounds , and yup , loved that t&a !i actually thought this was a comedy going in , but overall , it plays more towards the dramatic , than a comedy . i also enjoyed jon voight 's performance as the stubborn dick coach , as well as many of the other character players on the team . this is not a classic f

Review: arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80 's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one - liners are getting worse. it 's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes ,but hey he got 15 million , what 's it matter to him ?once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that ca n't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world !parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . yes , the film is that

Review: in my review of there 's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter is n't everything ."i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter is n't everything , unless i 'm watching a jim abrahams film .see , spoofs are easy with me .i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .sometimes i 'm the only one in the theater laughing .sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high - pitched in comparison to my speaking voice( it cuts right through everyone else 's laughter ) .sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .abraham 's latest film , mafia !, induced this kind of hysteria upon me .it 's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i 'm the guy who laughs at everything .there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought - provoking .most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .mafia !has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . to describe the story of mafia ! is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !to his experience .he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .he looks like he 's having so much fun that he 's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .he 's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando 's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead - on in a full - blown mockery of sharon stone .the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i 'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! that i ca n't remember a lot of what made me laugh .but that 's a good sign : mafia !is so funny that i was n't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain.i know that does n't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .finally , a film that does this for me .
