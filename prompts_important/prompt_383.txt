Review: i must admit i 'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemptionhe justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . the story of serendipity is simple . two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .

Review: after enduring mariah carey 's film debut , glitter , i 'm reminded of a bit from chris rock 's bigger and blacker . in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that do n't mean it should be done . " to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly do n't mean it should be done . sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles ' a hard day 's night to the spice girls ' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . the film is inexplicably set in the 80s ,a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . worse yet, everyone 's speaking late 90s hip - hop slang in what should be 1983 . meant to be pa

Review: vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors .this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows .it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they would n't bother to write any jokes into the script .at least that 's the way it looks when watching this turkey .about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point .by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags .i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in .they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film 's best moments .every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .which brings me to the best moment of the film .the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . too bad .
