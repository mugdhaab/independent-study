Review: the disney studios has its formula for annual , full - length animated features down so pat that it 's hard to remember which one you 're watching at any given moment . " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines -- ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan -- get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . add the requisite love interest and a wise - cracking sidekick or two ,pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage - backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . bob 's your uncle !better make that walt 's your uncle .  .  . kids will no doubt go ga - ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie

Review: unfortunately it does n't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . there 's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops are n't immune ? ) . then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un - related plot point . dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they

Review: we 're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo 's vision of a william gibson - inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for .front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber - courier " who smuggles data via a " wet - wired " implant .he 's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long - term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . .the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed .he 's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice - t , and dina meyer .( dolph lundgren 's street preacher is in an acting category all its own .: - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places .the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx -- such as miniatures and mattes -- leave a lot to be desired .watch out for those bad blue - screens !we would n't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better .too bad the debut director is n't very strong in this de- partment .his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down .bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . skip it .
