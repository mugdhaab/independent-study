Review: one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton 's 1925 silent film seven chances . now i 've never seen seven chances , as i 'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he 's unwilling to marry her . his reasons ?well he 's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently do n't like to be roped or something ( hey , that 's the movie 's explanation .  .  . i 'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it 's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring . the audience should now hate this char

Review: mars attacks !( 1996 )- c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones .this is director tim burton 's finest film to date .many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films .however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 .you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film .it is completely wacked - out and unlike anything you 've ever seen .once the silly tone of the film is set , it 's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do n't mix .the plot is simple : martians invade the earth .but it 's different than any other invasion film .usually it 's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans .this time however , it 's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans .the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i 've seen in a long time.they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious .and about the special effects .the effects in mars attacks ! are just about the most flawless ones i 've seen to date .the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 % real .there are just a couple of scenes that do n't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship .also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise .but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .could it have been funnier ?certainly . was it funny enough ?yes .was i entertained ? absolutely .on a personal note , i 'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war - crazy general decker .finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see .while he 's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in ,he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue .the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him .
