Review: _ in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .  if you have n't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you have n't seen it -- well , i suspect you 're in a small minority !first thing 's first ?is it all it 's hyped up to be ?well , yes ?and no . it 's a good film , and there 's a lot to like about it , but it 's not without its problems . when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was --ai n't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real - life tragedy ? !i mean , what 's happened to hollywood 's script - writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?gads ,whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i was n't alone in that respect . it 's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) a

Review: i 'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing " disturbing behavior " with " scream . "maybe it 's because they 're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars ,both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me . but this is not the next in line with the " scream " flicks as well asthe " i know what you did last summer " soon to be flicks . it owes less to " halloween " and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . and it should have been . this is basically a rehash of " the stepford wives , " the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i 've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives .  or something like that . " behavior , " starring katie holmes of " dawson 's creek , " deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers

Review: you 'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .that 's a bit more difficult .the farfetched sci - fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .if you 're not nice to it , you lose .galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks 's spaceballs was to star wars ,an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean - spirited or malintentioned ."the show 's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over ."that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that 's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show 's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .jason nesmith( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .dane , who played a spock - like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character 's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar 's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die - hard fans .one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers .they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film 's only mean - spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .of course , they all think he is out of his mindand once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .taking shots at both the obvious and not - so - obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub 's fred a .k .a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " ,chen 's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , wo n't take it or something ." it 's a hoot , but it does n't stop there :weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier - than - thou attitude are n't far behind .galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it 's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments --it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .by grabthar 's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .
