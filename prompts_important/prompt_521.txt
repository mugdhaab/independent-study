Review: i have never been a " star trek " fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , " star trek : insurrection , " is no exception . dropping almost completely the hard - core sci - fi element of the previous one in the series , " first contact , " " insurrection , " tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out . also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . after returning to jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken

Review: everything in the phantom you have seen many times before andthere is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .billy zane is wooden as the hero .kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of .oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity butthis is so poorly played out you wo n't even care .about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery .however , if you re looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper .this is not a good movie .
