Review: romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top - notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleedingdid not : a solid , well - written screenplay . call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer do n't seem to mix well . gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name does n't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . gary oldman 's p

Review: i 've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i 'm watching a 40-year - old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy - feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready - made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams ' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self - indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly - laugh comedy served up with high energy . williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda 's ad for a

Review: has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot - driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 's lame brained men in black .will this guy ever get a real role ?he has the bruce willis syndrome .the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . .you know .enemy was one of the worst films of last year .not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight ,the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i did n't like how smith always magically out - smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .somehow , quality ca n't overshadow quantity .
