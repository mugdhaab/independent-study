Review: " something is fishy in the state of universal . " about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post - apocalypse nitty - gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . we 've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward " haircuts " of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget .  )now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . ( well ,

Review: there 's more to a quilt than fabric and thread -- each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . the " quilting bee " consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , w

Review: brian de palma 's snake eyes stars nicolas cage 's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by - the - numbers thriller .ryuichi sakamoto 's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .( the script by de palma and lost world 's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .only the latter is achieved . )cage plays rick santoro ,a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who does n't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog, he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ?that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .the movie 's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .the film takes itself all too seriously .at best , it is a 1940s - style b movie .a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .
