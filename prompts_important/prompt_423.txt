Review: with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . handing over the director 's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face - lift of immense proportions . instead of being a suspense / science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . a film like aliens comes along only once in a while, and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . aliens is an action film unlike any i ha

Review: tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ' ghetto ' side of every american city . there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin 's on a trip to arizona . there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . of course , there 's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there 's something so horribly familiar about it all . this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there 's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . it 's full of all the road movie cliches , an

Review: i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .i 'm big fan of perry 's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley 's on - edge , extreme acting was a riot .so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley 's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry 's big breakthrough .i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley 's best , in spite of david spade 's absence .i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .sadly , none of this came to pass .the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one - liners few and far between .perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it 's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it 's a farley flick .the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .and farley 's classic humor is widespread , too .almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot .guys , let 's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?stick to " tommy boy " , and we 'll all be " friends " .
