Review: at times , you 'd think edtv would be an entertaining film . i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ?but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone 's problems and settle his own . mcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans . frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flopthe newton boys . he overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every secondhe gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries . the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed 's step - father ) , who plays a cute role as the close - to - death old guy that makes all the witty comments . jenna elfman is good , ( but a

Review: " a bug 's life " may not be " toy story , " but it 's more close than " antz " was . i really liked " antz , " basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year 's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i 'm the first to admit that . maybe it 's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun-it 's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it were n't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good - not - great flick . " a bug 's life " has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it 's g - rated and not totally over kids ' heads like " antz " was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that 's completely innocent even when it 's also remaining perpetually clever . " antz " is still the more witty film , and i love

Review: whenever u . s .government starts meddling into other countries ' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says " look who 's talking !what have you done to the indians ?" however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes .hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s .those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus ' discovery of america .one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers .the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century .when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s .government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation .however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless .with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign .general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force is n't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest .instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt .charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . together with young lt .britton davis ( matt damon )they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo .geronimo :an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors .so , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies .almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people .although such elements of john millius ' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history ,they harm the story of geronimo .to be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . instead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . to make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two filmsbadly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers .the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo 's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood .the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting .wes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role .contrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies .while this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall .even hill 's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s .even his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic .on the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic .all in all , compared with some of the hollywood 's examples of political correctness , this film is n't so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better .
