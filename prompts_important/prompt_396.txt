Review: this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue - collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind - set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story :it is old news . the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her does n't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . the introduction of the wise - guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experien

Review: claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they 're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame - brained big - screen version of the 70s tv show .the story has all the originality of a block of wood( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver 's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come .by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they 're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate cast .
