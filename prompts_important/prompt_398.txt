Review: come on hollywood , surprise me .  stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal , because his niece is one of the victims . it 's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there 's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who 've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to .  .  . well , you know the rest . a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype

Review: this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron 's most heralded film , titanic . postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?my best guess . .  .  .  it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that 's where the problem lies . there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire

Review: claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they 're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame - brained big - screen version of the 70s tv show .the story has all the originality of a block of wood( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver 's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come .by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they 're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second - rate action picture with a first - rate cast .
