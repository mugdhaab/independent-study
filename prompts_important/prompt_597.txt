Review: most sequels do n't do what they 're supposed to do like " toy story 2 " does . far too many of them end up re - hashing the original and adding very little . is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?thankfully , " toy story 2 " is a wonderful exception . i ca n't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . it 's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind " toy story " and " a bug 's life , " is still at the top of its game . woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit " toy story , " and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . unfortunately , woody 's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over -

Review: it 's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city . just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h .  macy ) . they 're trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city 's hero numero uno , hogs all the action . the good captain has his own problems . because he 's all but eliminated crime , amazing 's endorsement deals are falling through . the public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one - time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city . so , no one is left to save the day but our would - be superheroes , but their abilities are more " little league " than " justice league . "the raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same ch

Review: i am continually amazed at movies like this .that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind - boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it 's still pretty boring .will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they 're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .talk about deeply developed characters .at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .the year is 1869 .several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .there 's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr .arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .i 'd go further with the plot , but there is n't any point .this film 's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .there is n't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , andthat 's pretty disasterous when you consider that it 's primarily a comedy .as i said , the fault is totally that of the script . when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .the leads could 've been played samuel l .jackson and robert de niro andthe film still would 've been awful .no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr .knife guy !"sound good .still , this film has a lot going for it visually .the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese 's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning .he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .i wo n't fault barry sonnenfeld either .he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really is n't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half - way point .the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .if " wild wild west " did n't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .as it is , it 's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , butthere is n't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .
