Review: the happy bastard 's quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there 's something about mary and dumb and dumber . since the duo directed and did n't write the script , i can assume that 's part of the problem . the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970 's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . his popularity has gone through the roof and he 's getting his career off the ground . then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . these two form an ill - timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed 's abandoned himand he 's about to lose his hand in a bowl

Review: synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra - cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians . meanwhile , the artist 's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her . comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it . drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey . mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well - made . it 'sone of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about . i 've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel . the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film . the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy 's vulnerable position 
Important Phrases: ['came as a surprise to me', 'was original , offbeat , and well - made', 'one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about', 'takes good advantage', 'definately check this movie out']

Review: upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .i 'm twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters .director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavilydo we sense any trouble .in the quiet after the music we muse that it 's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate 's hold of the family is n't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .note : this is the first movie review i 've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .: )
