Review: my first press screening of 1998 and alreadyi 've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . what an auspicious beginning !welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l .  a .  and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves 's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year 's crop of movies . as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . "we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung - ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . " having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . when , even in the beginning , the director ca n't get the small parts right , you can sense the mov

Review: after a stylistic detour with mrs . parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ), director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self - absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph 's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ?meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . until mrs . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . i found equinox , his last pre- mrs . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , manne

Review: i had an epiphany today .it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill ."it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it 's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .too bad i did n't trust my own instincts when something - or - the - other possessed me to see this movie .i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow ." that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozythat tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .i wish i 'd seen it when it was halloween .at least i would have been forgiving .hey , tis the season .the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously was n't going anywhere .now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .that 's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that 's different from utterly nonsensical .hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .. .well let 's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh - so - cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .riiiiight .y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .yeah .just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .ooooooo .hint : blood and guts only work a few times .sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it 's just ketchup and props and you 've got to come up with something better than that .there were just too many things in this movie that we 've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .each was more predictable than the last .why did n't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?sheesh .was i grossed out ?yes .did i get spooked a few times ?yes .but why ?i get really disturbed when there is no why .when there were n't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which was n't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .the characters were incredibly flat and cliched . not to mention downright annoying .you 've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they 're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .and of course , all three gals are babes .i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .keep that up , geoff , and you 'll qualify for the next batman venture .the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .and famke jansen (sp ? )because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante 's peak " three times for him : ) .all right , i concede .there were a couple of things i enjoyed .that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .i probably wo n't ride a rollercoaster for a while .and the machine they used to drive geoffrey 's character mad ( see , i do n't even remember their names ) .the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .it would n't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .thank god they did n't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .god , there is no hope .
