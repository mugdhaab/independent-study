Review: it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . there is no ocean , no drowningsand it does not conjure up memories of yet another ?ordinary people ' . in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . so what are the lessons learnt :1 .  do n't take your children to class reunions . 2 .  do n't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly - strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres ' and ?one fine da

Review: the happy bastard 's quick movie review holy manmore like holy crap . the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical - ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line - up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . it 's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . it does n't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild 's face seems t

Review: i 'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it 's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power - mongering .if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history .it has already been well - documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re - cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors ' guild - mandated pseudonym of alan smithee .that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor .and you could just smell the disaster brewing .if you 're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you 'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up .ostensibly , it 's a pseudo - documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big - budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) .when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called " an alan smithee film " -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it .among the parties interviewed are the film 's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them .it 's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes .what makes it even worse is eszterhas ' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times .michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg / ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas ' stock - in - trade .the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film .by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film - makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified .those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what 's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn .not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears .the producer is a " liar " who " slept in the white house ; " the media are " maggots " and " leeches " working for publications like " the new york slimes " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you do n't miss the joke ) .it does n't even matter that eszterhas tags " penile implant " after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self - deprecation .this is a petulant schoolboy 's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth .the last stomach - churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out - takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away .perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himselfthere was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career .pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego - driven " satire " of excess and ego .it 's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this .otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .
