Review: starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . ( he has a $ 6000 a week drug habit .  )ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self - destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l .  a .  with ambition and a nasty drug habit . he eventually gets a gig for $ 5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand - in for " alf " :chompers looks just like alf except he 's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spa

Review: i do n't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it 's something i used to wonder about when i was younger . i ca n't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i 'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . since birth , he 's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla .  , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . all the people in truman burbank 's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . people watch truman 's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of

Review: do n't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson 's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997 's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l - u - v, that 's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close - cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .jovovich , besson 's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they 've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel - level babe ) .and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan 's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .besson 's big mistake, i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue - eyed christ figure on display in besson 's hallucinatory dream sequences .the whole conceit turns into a disasterright about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as " the conscience " ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .that 's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she 's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killingshe 's overseen and joanstarts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who 's about to take a fall .as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .trouble is , he 's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it 's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent ,nothing more than a put - on .this glib , pre - fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer 's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan 's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .--------------------------------------------------------------directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france / usa , 1999 theatrical aspect ratio :2 .35: 1 --------------------------------------------------------------
