Review: as with any gen - x mtv movie ( like last year 's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . those two items , wrapped in a guilty - pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre is n't mainstreamand it 's been retread to death . second ,the sex is just bad . despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all - night strip - club party , there 's nothing even remotely tantalizing . the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes ' twenty - two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans

Review: the word ' rest ' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all .what does takes place is more based on character development .the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people :nick , beth , carol and sid .what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at .nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana .( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . )carol is nick 's ex - girlfriend and beth 's best friend, sid is a joint - smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in .obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there 's a lot of things left out .it 's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job is n't mentioned .and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he has n't seen them for many years .set in a small ( fictional ? ) town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings .the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future .particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i 'll keep an eye on her in the future .interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated ' barntill ?ten ' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it .
