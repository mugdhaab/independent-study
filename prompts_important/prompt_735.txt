Review: "the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . although it 's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . based on graham greene 's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . there 's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile 's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he 's just a normal guy . it 's all work and no play with him . while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . unfortunately the two break up . this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . it 's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . while this may sound straight forward it 's not . it 's a deep dark

Review: bruce willis is a type - casted actor .in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over - the - hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes .in luc besson 's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time .a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element 's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 .an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the " 5 elements " are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back .cut to present day , which is our future .the year is 2023 , and new york is the city .the only basic differences between besson 's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats !anyway , the " evil " comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise - like aliens to return the " 5 elements " to earth , in order to defend themselves against the " evil ." in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing .when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand .what can you do with a hand ?hey , its the 21st century here - dna reconstruction !this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) .she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben 's floating cab .it 's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy - as - always cops .when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the " yellow pages " and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties .now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements .it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean - baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) .he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig - like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) .in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem - why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ?the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered .but enough of that .when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruction .the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm ,an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson 's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich .the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim " tiny " lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film .although besson 's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point .some other directors ( like anaconda 's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy - using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film .sci - fi fan or not ,any movie - lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture . ,
