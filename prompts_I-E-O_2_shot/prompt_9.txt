Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film 's pathetic screenplay .every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs .so much for the script .how about the action ?well , let 's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator --all standouts for their hair - raising suspense .by contrast , harlin does n't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so badit 's good .you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .
