Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the word ' rest ' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all .what does takes place is more based on character development .the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people :nick , beth , carol and sid .what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at .nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana .( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . )carol is nick 's ex - girlfriend and beth 's best friend, sid is a joint - smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in .obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there 's a lot of things left out .it 's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job is n't mentioned .and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he has n't seen them for many years .set in a small ( fictional ? ) town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings .the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future .particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i 'll keep an eye on her in the future .interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated ' barntill ?ten ' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it .
