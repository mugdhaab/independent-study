Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors .this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows .it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they would n't bother to write any jokes into the script .at least that 's the way it looks when watching this turkey .about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point .by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags .i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in .they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film 's best moments .every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .which brings me to the best moment of the film .the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . too bad .
