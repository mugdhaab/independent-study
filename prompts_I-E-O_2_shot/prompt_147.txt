Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: bruce lee was a bigger - than - life martial artist ( and ) actor .bruce 's unique character ( i .e . ,self - produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee .the story is told from his wife linda 's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee 's life .however , you ca n't helpbut like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character .i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee 's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english .it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else .scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all - white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes .it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes .in conclusion , the movie was well made, it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor .and the fighting scenes were all excellent .so go see it and enjoy the movie .p . s .if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven .
