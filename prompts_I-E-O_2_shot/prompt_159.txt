Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece .certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970 's .the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad 's " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war ." apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history .the plot is fairly simple .captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty .his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " .along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt .col .kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies .willard ' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz ' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives .willard 's experiences with kurtz take up the last half - hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending .the movie is visually breathtaking .the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first - rate .the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening .the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie .the journey to kurtz ' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character .the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt .col .who cares more about the surf than about the mission .it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , andit is one hell of a movie .the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne .the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz .coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd .the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution .the problems come when the film slows down .one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess .the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film .the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound .the film slows down to a drag .sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received .brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic .the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief .sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told .the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god - like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations .granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion .brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ?there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene .there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending .the finest scene at the end is sheen 's escape , and his entrace into the temple .his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film .yet , you can not shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done .the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good .it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man 's mental stamina during bouts of war .but one still can not shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for .there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .
