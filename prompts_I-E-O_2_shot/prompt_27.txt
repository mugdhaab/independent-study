Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it 's only 80 minutes long and when it 's overyou 're glad that you did n't waste more than an hour and a half of your time.it 's nothing more than a bad rip - off of , " jaws" ( and i think that 's being kind . )it was written by david e .kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror - comedy butfails at both , miserably.i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once .the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda ."the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt )flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .there 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .as i mentioned before kelley and director steveminor ( h20 ) do n't go for a serious approach towards the material butthey also do n't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting, they 're all basically idiots .if they had any brains the croc would n't have been that much of a challenge to catchand they would n't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movie .basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
