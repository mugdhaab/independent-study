Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .i 'm big fan of perry 's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley 's on - edge , extreme acting was a riot .so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley 's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry 's big breakthrough .i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley 's best , in spite of david spade 's absence .i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .sadly , none of this came to pass .the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one - liners few and far between .perry and farley have no chemistry; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it 's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it 's a farley flick .the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .and farley 's classic humor is widespread , too .almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon - train by quite a longshot .guys , let 's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?stick to " tommy boy " , and we 'll all be " friends " .
