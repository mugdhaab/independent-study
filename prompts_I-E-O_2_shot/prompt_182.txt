Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film - making .after all , it 's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing / directing teams .even if most people do n't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few .but although the zucker / abrahams / zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts .in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high .films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits .there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade .and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film .this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . .it had to do with bad fish .airplane !is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex - fighter - pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . unable to stop living in the past , ted 's world fell apart .he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) .in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working .unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self - pity .in the midst of it all , something happens .someone gets sick .then another .then another .soon , the whole plane is full of deathly - ill chicago - bound people ...and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul - jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ?( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non - stop " whiz - bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags .although i had seen this movie a few times before ,i was still laughing thru the entire thing .the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen .he 's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight - faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film .in a film like this , you 're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one ca n't complain about the amateurish quality .what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker .this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny .i do n't know why he was put in there , and i do n't think anybody will find a good excuse .and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old .you got ta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long .aside from that , airplane !is really a top - notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic .it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they have n't seen it .and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em" it 's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that 's not important right now ."if you 've seen the film , you 'll understand ; - )
