Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .take the professional , for example .it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .it 's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle - aged man and a twelve - year - old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d .e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda 's father tried to rip him off .leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .writer / director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close - ups and evocative lighting .but beneath the shiny wrapper , there is n't nearly as much going onas besson would like us to believe .the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he 's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she does n't have too much to work with , either .besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .gary oldman 's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild - eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .there is n't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which is n't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve - year - old in a really distasteful way .there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda 's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he 's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman 's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9 mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world ca n't disguise that fact .
