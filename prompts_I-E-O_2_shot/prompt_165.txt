Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise .i do n't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i 'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence .usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo .it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly .that 's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .what 's more , it 's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp - witted lesson in english social history .princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good - hearted gentlewoman mrs .worrall ( wendy hughes ) .her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none - too - pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr .worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs .worrall .however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr .worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs .worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co - writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light - hearted to be heavy - handed .he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a " sensation " at court .in one of the film 's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .the performers are mostly delightful, particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs .worrall; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls ' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world - weary but ultimately romantic gutch .only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess 's identity .the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo is n't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out .it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding -- a hidden gem .
