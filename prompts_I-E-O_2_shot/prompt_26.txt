Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what 
Important Phrases: what 's the deal ?, mind - fuck movie, a very bad package, just did n't snag this one correctly, executed it terribly, it 's simply too jumbled, downshifts into this " fantasy " world, have no idea what 's going on, i get kind of fed up after a while, not really, the sad part is, do we really need to see it over and over again ?, mind - fuck movie, pretty redundant, the film does n't stick, it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites, skip it !

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliami 've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid .dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last .then there 's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine - laced dose .mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing .acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy .my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie .full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s .thompson 's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world - view from the inside out .but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well - made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag .fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self - professed " gonzo " journalist hunter s .thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney 's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 .operating under the pseudonyms of " raoul duke " and" dr .gonzo " , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi - colored uppers and downers .they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them .duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge .dr .gonzo becomes enamored of a thick - bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane 's " white rabbit " reaches its climax .and these guys do n't just trash hotel rooms- they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead .that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view .thompson 's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document .it simultaneously exposed the 60 's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die .pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson 's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy .it 's a cheech and chong movie .you 're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results :see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down .there 's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard .this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close - ups , wide - angle lenses , dutch tilts and other - worldly lighting schemes .there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .but to what end ? much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson 's book , and there are some priceless comic observations .but you 're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work .this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong .depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson 's dialogue .in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr .gonzo , buthe also mumbles and sputtersso many of his lines that their weight is lost .watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see .it 's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co - writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over .as much of a fan as i am of gilliam 's work , cox would have been the better choice .sid and nancy , cox 's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film .gilliam commits the compound sin of over - directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose .what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ?it does n't try to be a cautionary tale , and it does n't work as broad comedy .if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film .but i do n't want to be too hard on it .there are some truly funny moments , and if you 're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it .i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance- i guarantee it will enhance the effect .
