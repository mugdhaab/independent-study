Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: it seems like i 'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now .scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again - the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the " relentless " department .i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it 's citizen hook .jennifer love - hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james - who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking up .she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman - victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals .paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station 's 4th of july getaway giveaway .bikini - ready julie invitesboyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who - and here 's the movie 's biggest mystery - turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take - off . until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell - liner himself , that is .unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla 's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy - next - door type who 's sweet on julie .to make a long story short - i ca n't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set - up for this gratuitous sequel - the trip is a disaster .not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners ' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one - by - one , but the karaoke machine is n't working properly !( you think killing is hard ?try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor 's " i will survive" now contains the lyric" i still know what you did last summer ! " )all is not lost - ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co .this picture is really about breasts : two of them .julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan .based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i ca n't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me- he gets jennifer love - hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp !lucky bastard .i did n't likei know what you did last summerand i ca n't say i liked this continuation any more or less .the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ?i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis 's random selection of victims .( i do n't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest ideawhat julie did last summer . )director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one - if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here 's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series - someone who wo n't rely on so many shock notes .and let that person run wild with the camera .( aside : if blandy [ sic ] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says " baby " to a minimum .thanks in advance . )
