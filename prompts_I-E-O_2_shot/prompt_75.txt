Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: everything in the phantom you have seen many times before andthere is nothing new presented here. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .billy zane is wooden as the hero .kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of .oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity butthis is so poorly played out you wo n't even care .about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery .however , if you re looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper .this is not a good movie .
