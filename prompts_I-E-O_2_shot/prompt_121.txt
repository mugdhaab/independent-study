Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well - worn material .the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop-- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .the reason ?mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .or if our passports were n't missing .
