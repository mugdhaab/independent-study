Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: how could a g - rated disney film based on meg cabot 's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ?easy .take all the cute , harmless fun out of it .and while you 're at it make it borrr - ring .that 's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g - rated disney film " the princess diaries ."you could n't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass .of growing , glowing pre - pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy - duddy old me ) .well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious .too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall 's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride" --but this one 's way without julia robertsso maybe*that 's * its problem ) .in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it( it 's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we have n't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) .marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he 's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two is n't working . . .and hardly* any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there 's none of that here either ) .newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way* not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all minisculeeuropean countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones / tiara combo in the print ads ) .julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia 's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia 's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ?not really .consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets .also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky - looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic / musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia 's chauffeur - driven limousine at every intersection .a non - animated g - rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product .lame , labored , and lamentable, " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight - and - a - half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) .
