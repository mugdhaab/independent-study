Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: wong kar - wei 's " fallen angels " is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i 've seen in a long while .unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for .ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of " fallen angels " , this is not so .every shot in this film is excitingjust to * look* at .wongdoes really interesting things with the camera , but he does n't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal " knock off " ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . ugh . )the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives .i ca n't say much more than that as i did n't really know what was going on most of the time .in fact , it was n't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character .the constantly moving camera does n't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character .we 're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters ." fallen angels " isa refreshing change - of - pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level .in fact , i 'd go so far as to say that " fallen angels " is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i 've ever seen .sure , there 's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images istruly something worth celebrating .but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images .there were far too many instances during " fallen angels " in which i asked myself , " now who are these people again ?is this that first couple or the second couple ?"it was impossible to keep track .perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with " name cards " , as in scorsese 's " mean streets " .that 's really besides the point , though .wong kar - wei has proven himself , through very few films , that 'she 's a movie - maker to watch .let 's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .
