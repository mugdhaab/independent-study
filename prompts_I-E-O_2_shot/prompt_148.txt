Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another .midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood - directed film clint is n't even in , andit 's damn good . adapted from a best - selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head .and that 's just the mayor .as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor .like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion .the acting , from big - time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you 'd expect , but it 's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm .cusack plays a free - lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey 's parties .lots of food , beverages and gunplay .yes , an employee of spacey 's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead .it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there 's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in .the weird circle of entertainment .this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in .there 's the requisite sexy woman ( alison " nepotist 's daughter " eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite .miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his / her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ?chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie 's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie .there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating .certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey 's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly - guy as the jury 's foreman .it 's herewe realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey 's homosexuality .yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course .midnight in the garden of good and evil is n't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity - directed , true - story best - seller adaptations out there .likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great .in fact , i 'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category .serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !
