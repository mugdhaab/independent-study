Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california .there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy .when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled .dan gauthier , gugino 's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino .gugino is n't ready for anything like thisso she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore .she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end .forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son - in - law is the film to see this summer .son - in - law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez .when son - in - law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then .this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it .nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen .although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch .the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around .the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old .there are also several new jokes that , at least , i have n't seen before .still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still .this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that does n't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price .the cast for this film does an excellent job .pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film .he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience .pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious .this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role .carla guginodoes a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl .she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time .the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job .the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen .patrick renna , who played gugino 's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him .tiffani - amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , " saved by the bell " ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen .she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television .she was n't given overly much to do in the film , but what she had ,she does a good job with .
