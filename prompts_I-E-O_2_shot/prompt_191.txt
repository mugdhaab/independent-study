Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: in _ daylight _ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , buthe covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _ daylight _ movie posters on it .i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out .it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering .so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably wo n't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie ," so i signed up .all in all , i do n't think i got that bad of a deal , either .rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _ dragon :the bruce lee story _ and , more recently ,_ dragonheart _ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ?you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after - effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _ cliffhanger _ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed .when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out .there are other similarities to _ cliffhanger _ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _ cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _ daylight _ 's bad guy is mother nature .in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _ cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film " sequels " do to their predecessors .the first half - hour of _ daylight _ is setup .subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled .we meet all the important people . . .toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others .we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons .and then , thirty minutes into the film ,_ boom _ .and it 's a big one .> from there on in, it 's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly - style .again .. .there 's nothing new here .and yet there does n't need to be .the fun of _ daylight _ is not in the story but in the execution .the special - effects are first - rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together.once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .this review is copyright 1996 by christophere .meadows .permission granted for distribution through rec .arts .movies .reviews and all associated archival .permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached .all other rights reserved to the author .
