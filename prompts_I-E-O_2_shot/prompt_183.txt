Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: this is the movie not the perfume .a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock 's vertigo .it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader .set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ?ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) ,both look up to him beaming with joy .his real - estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes . upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroomand he is left with a ransom note to deliver $ 500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed .inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers .but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper 's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found .grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt - ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop .sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife .when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife .her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ?ve bujold )and she 's working there restoring art that is decaying .he falls instantly in love with her and does n't heed bob 's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her .sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him .the surprises to come were n't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ?ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow .it plays too much like a rehash of the master 's work , to break any new ground , yetit is still thrilling in its own way .
