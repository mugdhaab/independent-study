Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .official release : halloween reviewed by vince yim` you think you know all about vampires . . .believe me . . .you know f* ck all . 'with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .so , what 's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?with that out of the way , let me say this .this film is bad .this film is really , really bad .yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ?buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ?any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . period .razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , does n't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the ` opium of the peoples ' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .but aside from that , it does n't stray too far away from horror film conventions .that is , unless that is intentional .razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .you ca n't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .you 'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .you 'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .and then , there 's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin - tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you 've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .but in case you really care , she 's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so - called illuminati , and she 's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .almost destined for cult - status , the film 's campy , cheesy overtonesactually work towards the film .while this may not necessarily be the film you 'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .
