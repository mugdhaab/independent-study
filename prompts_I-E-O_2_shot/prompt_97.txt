Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar .the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves .meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession .comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ?it 's hard to speculate .most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar .in case you have n't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom - of - the - barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad .the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible .writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging .there 's really not much to say .the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist 's agent .he is so horrible in this role that one ca n't help but be amused .the plot sucks .nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole .the dialogue stinks .a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really does n't need to know .everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits .as the names of the not - so - talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist ."someone could have used an editor !to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes .playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here .i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie .why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ?as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i 'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
