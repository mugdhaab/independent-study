Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: susan granger 's review of " bread and tulips " ( first look pictures ) in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice .for the first time in years , rosalba 's on her own when she 's abandoned at a highway rest area .although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing - supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she 's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she 's never visited .rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning .to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) .film - maker silvio soldinigently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle - aged , middle - class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red - and - white dress with platform - soled espadrilles .the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low - key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage - therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber - turned - private eye who 's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who 's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house .on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " bread and tulips " is a beguiling , escapist 8 .as the summer ends , it 's a magical getaway for mature audiences . .
