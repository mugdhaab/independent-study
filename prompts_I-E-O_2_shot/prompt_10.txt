Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: i admit it .i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies .watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids .it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation .and you know they 'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa 's elves .he later decks a reindeer .hey , man , why do n't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you 're at it ?jingle all the way is formula crap that follows theif someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought .arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene .what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents ca n't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ?arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son .he races from the office to his son 's karate game , only to find out he missed it .and his kid distrusts him because he 's never around .( gee , we have n't seen that in a movie before .) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son 's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago .so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare thanthe tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out .let me back up for a minute here -- arnold 's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief .watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin ' turboman sheets .i 'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it 's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo ,the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who do n't recognize him until the last minute .this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory .most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll .capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful.never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( " your cookies are incredible " ) , it 's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it 's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want .maybe that 's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .
