Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: it 's a shamethe execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there 's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .not that there 's anything wrong with scatology .i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .it 's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .adults ?well , let 's just say most will find it unappetizing.osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .frank 's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .it 's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate 's mouth .like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier 's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?s of that genre .and this is why osmosis jones does n't click .it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .the jokes and puns are lame: osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he does n't look fluish ."and the jokes do n't rise above that level .the live action scenes are no better .frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .he 's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat .it lacks scope and depth .it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .
