Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer .their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry - spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone 's taste , but certainly a well - crafted movie .possibly that movie 's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . .and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters ' future , sothere was no need to film it .there was actually about four hours ' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on - screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails .the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls .we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent )who 's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . .but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner .in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who 's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we 're left feeling good about her future .this is not one of the great movies , but it 's far better than we 'd been led to expect by all the negative pre - release publicity .verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter - century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially - acceptable limits to movie - making .his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back - door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he 's exploring the sleeze .this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director 's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie .( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . )many reviewers have taken the politically - correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it 's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist .it 's about the scum who use other people as power - trip toys , and the need to escape their power .it 's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values do n't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment .an nc-17 movie which is n't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value .the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator .if anything , it 's a rape scene with a victim who 's been duped into cooperation .you do n't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you do n't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you do n't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . .and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing .this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity .showgirls de - glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness .nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who 's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she 's known .she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be .when nomi realizes she 's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be .gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi 's entire life .molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she 'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi 's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi 's decision .gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who 's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her .gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self - awareness .her character is very well drawn and performed; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi .the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path .it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard - working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality .cristal is a talented dancer who 's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co - operating part of the system , exchanging self - respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas .nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and does n't need las vegas or its brand of " stardom ."the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist .kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy .glenn plummer plays a dancer who 's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective .plummer 's character is the only one in the movie who 's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he 's succumbed to the cult of manipulation .plummer 's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie .some of jost vacano 's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi 's character alteration , a no - dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying .this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well .i do n't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie - making .but do n't go see it if you 're not in a tough mood ; the only person it 's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i .c .u . on life support , andthere is probably not one character in this movieyou 'd enjoy meeting in person .
