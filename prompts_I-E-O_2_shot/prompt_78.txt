Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .it 's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , butit does n't make a shred of sense .and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor .but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .at least we have chow yun - fat in the lead role .chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop .he 's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he 's very familiar with chinatown .that 's probably why the powers - that - be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .nick and danny begin by stepping on each other 's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one 's life .what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .i 'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .i 'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .i 'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , althoughthis makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .there 's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny 's father ( brian cox ) , but it does n't have much to do with the main story .one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie does n't make any sense .i do n't blame this entirely on foley , because he 's obviously a good director .i 'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci 's script , which does n't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .one scene early on had me particularly annoyed :nick confronts his boss because he 's angry about his new white partner .he 's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . )there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent.there 's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .the plot itself never straightens out .i 'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group .the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .the sequences are n't bad , but they 're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?one too many , i 'd imagine .foley 's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here .the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he 's still fun to watch .i also liked the subplot involving danny 's father ; brian cox 's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes .a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it 's over .the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of controluntil , finally , there 's nothing left to hold on to .
