Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel 's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america .muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia .she is often the target of her father 's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage .her self - loathing is such that only being wedshall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired .after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel 's wedding unfolds from there .toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted .collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character .she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma ,easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance .collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene .muriel 's father , bill " the battler " heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician / developer .while chumming around with young fans and crowing ' you ca n't beat progress ' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments .rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel 's cheeky new friend in the film .she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off - screen .muriel 's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two - dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan 's scripting muriel 's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm .hogan 's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . hogan 's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel 's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window - shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her .the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .muriel 's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p .j .hogan .on my four star scale , i give muriel 's wedding three stars .
