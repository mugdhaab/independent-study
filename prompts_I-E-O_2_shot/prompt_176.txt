Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock .others will mention meg ryan .but for me , it 's not even close .janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywoodright now .and it 's a good thing she 's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull .garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls .in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory 's that never moved to america .unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town 's annual matchmaking festival .things get off to a rocky start for marcy though .she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche ' )she has to stay inhas a visitor in her bathtub .his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed .the movie runs into a few roadblocks .for instance , the story is very thin .none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo .some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie .i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , andseveral close - ups of garofalo 's winning smile .the strange thing is that it works .garofalo 's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .
