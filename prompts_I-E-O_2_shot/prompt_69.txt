Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what 
Important Phrases: what 's the deal ?, mind - fuck movie, a very bad package, just did n't snag this one correctly, executed it terribly, it 's simply too jumbled, downshifts into this " fantasy " world, have no idea what 's going on, i get kind of fed up after a while, not really, the sad part is, do we really need to see it over and over again ?, mind - fuck movie, pretty redundant, the film does n't stick, it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites, skip it !

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: " easely one of the worst films of the year . ." with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century .this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil .the result is somewhat predictable .i did n't have high hopes about arnold 's " much anticipated " return to the big screen .schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers wo n't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry .everyone else will see ' end of days ' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture .think of it as hollywood 's own y2k bug .did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you 'll get 999 , as in 1999 ?yes , you better believe it . .satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days .this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold .he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc .the way it works is he smirks and something explodes .before the stroke of the new millennium he 's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations .only schwarzenegger 's cop attached to an anti - terrorist unit can stop him .films like this has one serious weakness -- logic .no matter how you twist the " plot " , you 'll find it incredibly stupid( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) .the incredible fact is that such directors never learn .after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? .here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution .he is walking around n .y ., blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius .all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special .but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks, he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter .so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . .i can give you happiness that you can only dream of . .just give me the address . ." indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller .and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger 's comeback , will not be very satisfied .we 've not seen him in a while .that 's because he did n't have a worthy opponent .he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars .he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop .so , after all those fights , what 's left for arnold schwarzenegger ?how about satan ?in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron 's " terminator " .and that is schwartzenegger 's strength -- muscles and no emotions .here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar .this is called " an adult turn" if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful . make a wild guess !his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .this requires at least some acting skills .regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles .the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters .the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting .but the movie does n't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry .the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular .soi really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . unless you are a die - hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away .as for schwarzenegger , he 'll be back .
