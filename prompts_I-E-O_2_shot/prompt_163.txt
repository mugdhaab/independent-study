Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters ' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ' ravished and wracked faces . and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman 's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .all that is missing is a discussion of god .which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film 's rhythms .once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .though leigh may have adopted some of bergman 's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross - cutting during a married couple 's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any " style " at all .whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .much has been made of brenda blethyn 's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .there are a few missteps .for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film 's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .but for many of us , of course , so is life .and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .
