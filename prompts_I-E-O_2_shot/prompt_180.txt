Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son 's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .slow is the best description for the film at first .it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family .father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome .but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it does n't come across as a vanity piece .one might wish he had n't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character 's reactions so predictable .what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she 'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .self - propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so morettiintelligently uses this tool to separate the family .though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .in contrast , the son 's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .it 's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .
