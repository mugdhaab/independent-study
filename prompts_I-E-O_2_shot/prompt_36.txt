Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: brian de palma 's snake eyes stars nicolas cage 's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother .like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic .in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast .only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material .the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by - the - numbers thriller .ryuichi sakamoto 's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene .heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder .( the script by de palma and lost world 's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise .only the latter is achieved . )cage plays rick santoro ,a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money .the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held .with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who does n't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog, he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! "actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole .sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight .but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess .the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ?that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers .the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not .although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie .the movie 's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden .the film takes itself all too seriously .at best , it is a 1940s - style b movie .a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better .and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement .snake eyes runs 1 : 39 .it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .
