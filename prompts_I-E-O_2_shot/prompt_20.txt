Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what 
Important Phrases: what 's the deal ?, mind - fuck movie, a very bad package, just did n't snag this one correctly, executed it terribly, it 's simply too jumbled, downshifts into this " fantasy " world, have no idea what 's going on, i get kind of fed up after a while, not really, the sad part is, do we really need to see it over and over again ?, mind - fuck movie, pretty redundant, the film does n't stick, it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites, skip it !

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: ` the skulls ' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen - orientated doppelganger of ` the firm 'so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor .certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter .i chuckled incessantly , all the way home .let me share .the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i 'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) .luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report .despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization .soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $ 20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account .yeah ,dude , pretty good deal eh ?but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable .the premise , although lacking in originality, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense .unfortunately , ` the skulls ' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting .it 's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . ..but not the script .` the skulls ' is so badit attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers .first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm .afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar .will they never take this watch off ?and what if they forget it by their bedside ?perhaps their ?secret ' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed .on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters .gee , why not member t - shirts ?but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ?agree ' or ?disagree ' notions when making collective decisions .they are given official skull paddles .when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal .facing the opposite way means a disagreement .would n't they merely express themselves verbally ?hell no .they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping - pong .i 'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest .the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the ` dawson 's creek ' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout .but not entirely .accomplished actors like craig t .nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them .and then there 's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor .mcdonald 's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat - trick ) .i pray it was a ` snatch - the - paycheck - and - run ' exercise for all these actors .the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better .let 's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character .paul walker , the strapping quarterback from ` varsity blues ' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge 's son .walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( ` dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) .some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke 's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics .it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one .or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set - up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style .it makes you wonder why he did n't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like ` dragonheart ' and the moderate stallone thriller ` daylight ' are n't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash .aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , ` the skulls ' gets little accomplished .the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical .the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick .instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage .we 've seen it all before , and better .` the skulls ' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ?boneheaded ' seems just too generous .
