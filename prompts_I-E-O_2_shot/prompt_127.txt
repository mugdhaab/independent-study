Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: it was only a matter of time before a dilbert - esque office comedy hit the screens .however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .in his live - action directoral debut , judgeaptly spoofs corporate culture .the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before .. . in other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .he 's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .he 's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but has n't the guts to even introduce himself .everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over - effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .peter 's friends and co - workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . .no , not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend 's sudden change in attitude .but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .ron livingston tackles his role straight - faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .his character is n't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen - like clarity .he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .the animated roots of office space show in the film 's lack of complexity .most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh - and - blood cartoon .however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .it 's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far - fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .
