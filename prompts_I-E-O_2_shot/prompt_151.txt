Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house .the review two low - key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense .each has made well over $ 100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising .if a film 's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two .writer / director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit .the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue - collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie 's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party .while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party - goers , it triggers something in tom 's head .things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses .where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you .david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom 's house or just down the street .by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) .unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity .humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting .several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes .also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away .kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably .his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wifemaggie .kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most " wife who can no longer handle her husband " parts . while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watchesboth her husband and her son enter what she calls " a private club that i 'm not invited to " , where they whisper about things all day long .as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time .both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are .fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes .it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed - in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film .if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year 's best .
