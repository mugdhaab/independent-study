Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: warren beatty 's " bulworth " is a caustic political comedy that does n't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system .some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . however , as loud and raucous as it is , " bulworth " speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear .beatty , who directed the film and co - wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( " the lemon sisters " ) , stars as incumbent u .s .senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history .bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty 's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party .once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington .instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell - out money hound - if he 's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he 's making wind - bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , " america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . .blah , blah , blah ."when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become .in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $ 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he does n't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general .at a compton church , he tells the group of african - americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they " put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife ."later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he 'sthere is because " my guys always put the big jews on my schedule ."all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth 's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment .platt has some of the movie 's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet .his constant half - truth - telling and spin - doctoring to cover bulworth 's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self - righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy 's refusal to explain bulworth 's actions ( something he really can not do ) is somehow an act of treason .when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim - looking assassin to be who 's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews .at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner - city experience .bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally .she has a tough - talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l .d .( don cheadle of " boogie nights " ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth 's campaign .some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner - city films like " boyz'n'hood " ( 1991 ) and " menace ii society " ( 1993 ) ." bulworth 's " chief liability is beatty 's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device .instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip - hop stars are black .it 's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he 's actually that incompetent .at any rate , the rap sounds more run d .m .c .than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary .beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner - city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l .l .coolj .other than that, " bulworth " hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy .the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you do n't agree with beatty 's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics .unlike " primary colors " which opened earlier this year , " bulworth " does n't try to tip - toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead ,it takes them dead - on .
