Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: i had an epiphany today .it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill ."it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it 's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .too bad i did n't trust my own instincts when something - or - the - other possessed me to see this movie .i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow ." that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozythat tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .i wish i 'd seen it when it was halloween .at least i would have been forgiving .hey , tis the season .the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously was n't going anywhere .now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .that 's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that 's different from utterly nonsensical .hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .. .well let 's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh - so - cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .riiiiight .y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .yeah .just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .ooooooo .hint : blood and guts only work a few times .sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it 's just ketchup and props and you 've got to come up with something better than that .there were just too many things in this movie that we 've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .each was more predictable than the last .why did n't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?sheesh .was i grossed out ?yes .did i get spooked a few times ?yes .but why ?i get really disturbed when there is no why .when there were n't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which was n't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .the characters were incredibly flat and cliched . not to mention downright annoying .you 've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they 're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .and of course , all three gals are babes .i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .keep that up , geoff , and you 'll qualify for the next batman venture .the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .and famke jansen (sp ? )because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante 's peak " three times for him : ) .all right , i concede .there were a couple of things i enjoyed .that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .i probably wo n't ride a rollercoaster for a while .and the machine they used to drive geoffrey 's character mad ( see , i do n't even remember their names ) .the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .it would n't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .thank god they did n't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .god , there is no hope .
