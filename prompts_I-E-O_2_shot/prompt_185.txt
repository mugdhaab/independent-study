Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as 
Important Phrases: ably captures, oscar winner, the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent, the acting in from hell is solid, log in great supporting roles, it actually was n't half bad, the film , however , is all good

Review: when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input .jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer - generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone .i 'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe - filled response .an all - powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture - like skeksis .the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great " conjunction " of three suns .along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay - like kira , an ogre - witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic - but - friendly , tumbleweed - like animal named fizzgig .much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design .the puppeteering is phenomenal -- observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase -- but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately - narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue .the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone - perfect .as well , trevor jones ' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character .i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it could n't be helped , but i wish the film was longer .jen and kira have wonderful . . .well , chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated .the dark crystal has a very small cult following .the weaker labyrinth is probably better - known , which is upsetting .a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth 's creatures due to the financial failure of people - less the dark crystal .that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid - trip episode of " the muppet show " with david bowie as guest - host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien 's fan - base .( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . )the dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience .it 's the best kind of children 's entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageouslyun - hip .brian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father 's masterpiece .
