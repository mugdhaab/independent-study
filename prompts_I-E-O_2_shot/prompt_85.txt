Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: director doug ellin 's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story .like a sitcomwith jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it ,the movie meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame .the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless linesyou 've heard before .( " i 'm not wearing any underwear , " the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure - fire come - on line . )max , chicago 's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha .max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience .max is played without any style by david schwimmer .schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover .his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair .after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why should n't the personality - challenged be attracted ?the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test .jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act .max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does .the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work .neither the script nor the actors make this test believable ."the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you 're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ?" jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film .finally , there is the film 's attempt at physical comedy .jay 's ex - girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .natasha rips jay 's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa .as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it .this is supposed to be funny ?most films have some saving grace .some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture was n't . kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it .kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 .it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .
