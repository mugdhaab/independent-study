Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .( fitting , since the media - saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt .maj .archie gates ' ( who 's steering )command requests a beach boys tune .these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeetshoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles .our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they do n't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously - it 's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs .they are gates , new father sgt .troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt .conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) .at story 's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends .barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass - map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion .gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes - demands - that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt .ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy .so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam 's men are threatening the dictator 's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence .when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help .( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )gates convinces the vault 's guards that this is a post - war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would - be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .it 's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it 's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man 's affair with his bedridden mother .( it 's great . )his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .one could argue that it 's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no - nonsense about the violence .when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutesthe sound - we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .three kings is russell 's first visually arresting picture .stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .newton thomas sigel 's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .( a friend enthusiastically added , " it 's like having sand in your eyes . " ) this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )russell throws plenty at sigel 's camera for it to observe -as was the case with russell 's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film 's most realistic , even the most poignant .( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie - minded russell .subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish - barlow 's post - torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god - fearing - ultra - serious - anti - racist - black - man - of - power clich ?-so much for cube avoiding token status .( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor - marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go !"hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self - serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell 's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .( it 's not spoiling much to write that . )then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?( there 's already enough cynicism in the film 's mentioning of kuwait 's oil - infested waters . )russell offers the masses a primer on the oft - dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .if he set out to make something socially / culturally / politically / globally significant , he succeeded . with flair .
