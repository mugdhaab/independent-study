Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: "i know what you did last summer , " the first high - profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996 's " scream , " and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997 's biggest hit of the fall season .while " scream " was a more knowing film about the genre , " i know what you did last summer " is more reminiscent of a straight - forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom - of - the - barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the " friday the 13th " films ( well , okay ," jason goes to hell" was pure hell to sit through ) .the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n .c .it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways .kind - hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player .when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain - side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home .distraught and confused , they decide they ca n't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter ,so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him .julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry .switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out .almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , " i know what you did last summer , " and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook ."i know what you did last summer , " is a successful horror film for a number of reasons .the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings .the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort .and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set - pieces that are some of the most memorablei 've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family 's store with the killer inside with her .perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ), a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit .heche 's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time ."i know what you did last summer , " could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems .prinze jr .gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth .also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines .luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted " jump - in - your - seat " scare .in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i 've ever heard .she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best " scream queen . " and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered .although not up to the level of either " scream " movies , or the more recent , " urban legend , " " i know what you did last summer " is a respectable , smartly - scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made .
