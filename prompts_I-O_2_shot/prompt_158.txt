Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin ' bone here in what you call ?the biggest austin powers adventure yet . 'austin powers :the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery .many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film .austin powers :the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles .he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr .evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth .tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr .evil 's ?frisch 's big boy ' space capsule floating through space .dr .evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers ' " mojo " ,what keeps austin going with spy talents .upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr .evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr .evil , which is later named mini me .the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr .evil 's son in the madman 's mind ,because dr .evil thinks of scott to be only " quasi - evil ."dr .evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one .dr .evil tells mini me , " you complete me , " in a loving manner .dr .evil loving ?wow !mike myers ' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr .evil 's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers ' frozen body .austin powers learns of dr .evil 's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it .once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his " pad " , his smashing home / dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr .evil .as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr .evil , for example , " do n't go there , girlfriend ! " to the president of the united states .many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid-they 're funnycome a dozen per fifteen minutes .take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is .the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , soyou never stop laughing .there was honestly not one moment in austin powers :tswsm where i was n't laughing .the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers !it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it .the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , " it 's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike ."tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england .i can tell you one thing-he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters .i believe that dr .evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did .dr .evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austindid this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film .i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer .even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr .evil 's side constantly .the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsmactually shows some quality behind the frequent humor .mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles .( fat bastard )all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them .heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion .speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments .hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures .the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .
