Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) , except if you 're child ?in which case it would be called experimenting .rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . hardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed .despite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over .well , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life .and it 's sweet .drew barrymore who shone in ?ever after ' is wonderful as ?josie , grossy ' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter .it addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting .hard to believe , but possible .there may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss .so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it .either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending .
