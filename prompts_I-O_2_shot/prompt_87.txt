Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: thistalky , terribly - plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex - new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery after a light - plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat .he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that 's when the trouble begins .the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) .everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that 's curious but never compelling .based on the book by james lee burke , heaven 's prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing .early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves .nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa .later , dave is reunited with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation .huh ?the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf .whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess .in its present form , heaven 's prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .
