Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: a cinematic version of one of john irving 's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of " simon birch , " the treatment is merely " suggested by , " rather than strictly based on , the book .suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed " the world according to garp , " sold the rights to his novel " a prayer for owen meany " to the disney machine for $ 1 million , but would n't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names .that 's an odd decision -- irving claims it 's to protect both himself and the novel -- but it 's one that does n't unduly harm the finished product .irving 's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters ."a prayer for owen meany " is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy -- called simon birch in the film version -- who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high - pitched falsetto voice , " like strangled mice ."simon believes himself to be " god 's instrument , " placed on this earth to somehow effect god 's plan .simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally .smith 's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for " simon birch " ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function -- smith 's acting abilities are limited at best .another drawback is that in the book , simon 's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters -- in careful , loving detail . watching " simon birch , " however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended .simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith 's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one - liners he 's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film 's director and screenwriter .fortunately , simon birch is n't the real star of the film that bears his name .simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co - stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny .first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( " jurassic park " ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon 's best friend , joe .mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent .ashley juddpositively beams in her role as rebecca , joe 's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben .david strathairn and jan hooks play the town 's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .there 's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from .. .well , that would be telling .perhaps " suggested by " the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since " simon birch " only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon 's extraordinary life .the film also changes the book 's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon 's lot .the flavor of irving 's original novel remains , however -- the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .
