Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: we 're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo 's vision of a william gibson - inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for .front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber - courier " who smuggles data via a " wet - wired " implant .he 's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long - term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . .the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed .he 's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice - t , and dina meyer .( dolph lundgren 's street preacher is in an acting category all its own .: - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places .the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx -- such as miniatures and mattes -- leave a lot to be desired .watch out for those bad blue - screens !we would n't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better .too bad the debut director is n't very strong in this de- partment .his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down .bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . skip it .
