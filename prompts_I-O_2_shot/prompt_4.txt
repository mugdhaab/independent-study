Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects .but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer - director , the audience is left in the dark .the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him .he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars .then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five - year - old daughter .raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie 's brother , billy ( charlie creed - miles ) , of stealing .raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite )him to a bloody wreck .but these are the least of billy 's problems .billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it does n't seem that he 'll last much longer .billy and valerie 's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond 's nemesis .she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it .she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments .if this description seems bleak , i have n't told the half of it .this is not a cheery movie , and most of the timeit 's downright depressing .while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end ,it 's not quite worth it .there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose .take for example the extended sequence where one of billy 's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy .the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything .granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us .the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles .the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into .the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there 's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices .a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience .oldman got it about half right .
