Is this a positive movie review?
Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Is this a positive movie review?
Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the question is n't why has grease been reissued .the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie 's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount 's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?the answer is not an easy one .grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the ' 50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high - spirited.travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non - threatening .but grease did n't break any new cinematic ground .it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .what grease is - or has become - is the highest - grossing musical in film history .ok , let 's not be a spoilsport .grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton - john , taxi 's jeff conaway and the multi - talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .it 's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it 's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .between grease and 1996 's evita ., you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .today 's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .secondly , a lack of talent .performers with the charisma , the style , the larger - than - life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re - release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .perhaps not original musicals such as singin ' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber 's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .let grease be the word that sparks this revival .
