Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .i 'm twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters .director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavilydo we sense any trouble .in the quiet after the music we muse that it 's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate 's hold of the family is n't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .note : this is the first movie review i 've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .: )
