Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: i am continually amazed at movies like this .that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind - boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it 's still pretty boring .will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they 're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .talk about deeply developed characters .at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .the year is 1869 .several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .there 's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr .arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .i 'd go further with the plot , but there is n't any point .this film 's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .there is n't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , andthat 's pretty disasterous when you consider that it 's primarily a comedy .as i said , the fault is totally that of the script . when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .the leads could 've been played samuel l .jackson and robert de niro andthe film still would 've been awful .no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr .knife guy !"sound good .still , this film has a lot going for it visually .the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese 's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning .he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .i wo n't fault barry sonnenfeld either .he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really is n't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half - way point .the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .if " wild wild west " did n't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .as it is , it 's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , butthere is n't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .
