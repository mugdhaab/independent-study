Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: buffalo ?66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .the truth is he is n't married .to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you do n't need money to make a good film .buffalo ?66 does n't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .gallo 's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .gallo and ricci arrive at his parent 's house , andsome extremely funny scenes take place within the house .ricci 's performance during the scene at gallo 's parent 's home are very well done .there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine.gallo 's character is developed very well .the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .this character seemed very realistic to me .ricci 's character is funny and different .she does n't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves.buffalo ?66 is n't all laughs though .many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .gallo 's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .i really would have liked to see gallo 's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .overall , buffalo ?66 is n't as good as some people put it up to be .the bottom line-a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .
