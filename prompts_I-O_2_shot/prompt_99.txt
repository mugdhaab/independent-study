Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison .after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel .fortunately , for audience members there 's a chance to escape the nearest exit .this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy 's worst movie and that 's an accomplishment .remember the golden child , harlem nights ?compared to life , they look like citizen kane .life is long , predictable , foul - mouthed and only intermittently funny .its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years .robert ramsey and matthew stone 's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as " motherf . . .s " or " n . . . . .s ."you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used .and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie .but , like life , it will probably stink .to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up .but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well .life is as sophisticated as a belch .it 's crude and stereotypical .years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second - class people , good for being only maids and servants .for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved .but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies .in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast - talking , conniving , scam artists or hip - hop , gun - crazy , sex - crazed youths .both sets of caricatures are demeaning .and the fault does not rest with the actors .they have to eat , too .it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green - light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest .life 's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds .otherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it .see it at your own risk .
