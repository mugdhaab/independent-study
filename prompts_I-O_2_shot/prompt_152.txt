Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: being the self - proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently .after all , it 's considered by just about everyone to bethe masterpiece epic ofdirector david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago .so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it .i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt - numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration .but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against --the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound .after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen .based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t .e . lawrence during world wari , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then - unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever .bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re - assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army .lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world wari . shot in panavision 's famed super 70 mm format , the film beautifullyillustrates the definition of the word epic .it is absolutely breathtaking . using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes .every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land .david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today .after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i 've got to do a remake of this film !"but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern - day movie executive : " okay , it 's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert .we are going to need to blow up a full - size train because computer - generated effects probably wo nt do it justice .and we are not going to use any big stars , and wo n't have any female actors since there 's no love story ."yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden - era of hollywood a long time ago .but at least we still have the proof to show all would - be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .
