Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: burnt money is the perfect festival film .it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again .this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 's emerging masters series is easily one of the year 's worst.billed as a gay ` bonnie and clyde ' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ?eyro has its only highlight in a well - designed title sequence .two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry .this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . hiding out in a prostitute 's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie 's conclusion .if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love .as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying .or something like that .everything that happens is so quick and confusingi was completely lost .clarity is n't exactly this movie 's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up .not much could have really happened though .the main events in this long two - hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language .lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there 's a reason , but there 's no purpose to anything in this film .most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing .it appears pi ?eyro ( who co - wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement .he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go .burnt money is pointless .the performances are bad .it tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom.god forbid it will ever get a distributor .another disappointing film from this year 's so - called emerging masters series .pass on by .
