Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: bob the happy bastard 's quickie review :the mummy brendan fraser 's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone .. .fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) .it 's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in .but who cares ,the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to ityou ca n't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon .fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground .basically , it 's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress .his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible .of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising 's kevin j .o'connor ) and some " americans " . . .and guess what ?yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc .fire flies from the sky , flesh - eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep 's plan begins to unfold .ok , so it 's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough .the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz is n't half bad either .the action is pretty intense( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror - loving folks as well .no , it 's no phantom menace beater , but if you 're looking for a solid warm - up to the summer movie season , you wo n't find a better film under wraps than the mummy .if this does n't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .
