Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the verdict : spine - chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar - winning performance from kathy bates .geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this !sorry , non - british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies .the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in " absolutely fabulous " ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery .needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder 's legs ! but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i 've now seen the film a couple of times now , that " hobbling " scene was no less disturbing !i 'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion !that may be the most memorable scene , but it 's certainly not the only worth watching .stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale .it 's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) .rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer 's " number one fan " , he soon becomes her prisoner .both the script and kathy bates ' beautifully masterful performance( for which she won an oscar ) work arm - in - arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit - cake ( or is that fruity as a nut - cake ? ) .bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she 's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she 's just damned scary !this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .it 's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it 's basically a two - hander , mainly set in one locale, it 's a remarkable piece of cinema .there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner 's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .oh , i have n't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who 's a prisoner of his own success( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .along with the pig , of course !anyway , the tension is built - up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .there 's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve - shattering lengths to poison her wine .he succeeds , but . . .she knocks the glass over !i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !in the immortal words of homerj .simpson - " d'oh ! !"other nerve - wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .we cut to annie in her car -she 's on her way home .. .he realises this and tries to get back to his room . . .cut to the car again , she 's getting near . . .will he make it ?ok , so these sequences are n't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !boy , do they work !if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it 's doing something right !of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned " hobbling " !annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she 's going to stop him onceand for all .cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . .i feel ill just thinking about it !nasty .it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !and then we 're given one of the most ridiculously over - the - top fight scenes i 've ever seen .she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just wo n't die !sheldon is n't in terribly good shape either .if it were n't so gorey it would almost be laughable .but it 's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .the directing is first - rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .wonderful stuff .?-* - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly - updated film and tv reviews , check out my site !http : //www .geocities .com / hollywood / bungalow/4960 -* -* - * - * - * - * - * - * -
