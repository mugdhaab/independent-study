Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: so here is the second of 1999 's remakes of classic horror movies .the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic ' the haunting ' .now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill .the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house .if they survive the night they get the money .if not well you get the jurisdiction .having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i was n't sure if i would really like the remake .but sure enoughit comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on.geoffrey rush( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people .his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends .steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list .somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party .eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex - baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex - assistant who can re - wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk - show host in sorts , dr .blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart - mouthed humorist in ways .what he is gon na do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night .if they can they get the money , if not well they do n't .the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum .years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr .there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they .everyone who was in there burned to death .now it is steven price 's homeand he is throwing this party for these five people .what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night .the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .one - by - one the people start to disappear .conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all .the people find rooms , which once held mental patients .rooms which once had people dying .rooms which may still contain these people .now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results .since i officially have n't seen the original i ca n't say which is better .i can say howeveri liked this movie .geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role .famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary .i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .one thing i knew not to expect was a ' haunting ' type movie with special effects galore .even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn 's show all the way throughbut you can tell .the movie was written well , and it 's only major flaw is the under - developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending .instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really ca n't take seriously .though it is a well - made movie with a good storylineit still has some flaws .but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this ca n't be made all the time !
