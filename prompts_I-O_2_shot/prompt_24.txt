Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: toward the bottom of the ' 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .this carl " apollo creed" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs .evil establishment crook , and relies on all the ' 80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , " you tore his arm off !" jackson replies , " he had a spare ."jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take ityou 're not one of dellaplane 's friends . "" not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .and of course it turns out stone is mrs .dellaplane .faux pas , jackson . ..not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .it 's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane 's nightclub .after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation ."he responds , " you 're getting one , " and it 's damn clever because he 's sitting down at the time .prince would n't even let out an innuendo that lameand he 's the king of the horndogs .. .or at least the prince .it 's a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they 're given , there 's not much room for improvement .my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone 's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head ."jackson 's response is , " i think i felt that way once .they called it love ."you 'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !
