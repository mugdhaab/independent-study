Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: you 'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .that 's a bit more difficult .the farfetched sci - fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .if you 're not nice to it , you lose .galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks 's spaceballs was to star wars ,an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean - spirited or malintentioned ."the show 's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over ."that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that 's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show 's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .jason nesmith( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .dane , who played a spock - like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character 's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar 's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die - hard fans .one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers .they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film 's only mean - spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .of course , they all think he is out of his mindand once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .taking shots at both the obvious and not - so - obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub 's fred a .k .a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain ! " ,chen 's cry for help is more to the tune of " the core , like , wo n't take it or something ." it 's a hoot , but it does n't stop there :weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier - than - thou attitude are n't far behind .galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it 's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments --it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .by grabthar 's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .
