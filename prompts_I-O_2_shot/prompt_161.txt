Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: an indian runner was more than a courier .he * became * the message he was carrying .what danger is a bear , to a message ?i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna - marrying , loudmouth .but all that has changed now .the guy has grown up .and that 's not all .it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication .one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper .but , no .this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash .the focus of the story is two brothers .david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer .viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he ca n't name , much less resolve .the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line .it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared .the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere .it is n't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them .life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems .this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face .in fact , i 'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing .there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw .i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free - form sections which also work very well .the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do -- this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all .in my opinion , it is worth full - price admission .
