Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: the farrelly brothers ' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real - life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance .plot : high - school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom .unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! )caught in his zipper , and misses the big night .thirteen years later , ted still ca n't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her .once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that 's when the real fun begins .critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that wo n't ever put you to sleep .having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys ' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics .this one is also quite funny , but it did n't really blow me away like the others .then again , maybe my expectations were too high .then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking / disliking the film .continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys ' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together .this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun - making of the disabled and mentally - challenged .i must admit that i really was n't sure whether to laugh at some points or not .not a good place to be .having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline .the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) .on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture .i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting .also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film 's trailer .and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still ca n't seem to find the " right guy " ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) .i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) .i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux - sympathy british accent .funny stuff .also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip - synched version of " build me up buttercup " , which is really cool .overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes .little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script " dust to dust " into the hands of eddie murphy via ?murphy 's neighbour .they only found out about murphy 's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night .matt dillon is a high school dropout .in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business .close to home in his native new york , he co - owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls .cameron diaz stands 5 " 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats .ben stiller 's father is jerry stiller .he played george costanza 's ( jason alexander ) father on tv 's " seinfeld " .peter farrelly has written a novel entitled " outside providence " which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin .rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber .he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor / correspondant julie moran .harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly 's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .
