Review: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what 's the deal ?watch the movie and " sorta " find out .  .  . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ?well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled. it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member ,have no idea what

Review: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as

Review: if you 've been following william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he 's played some rather similar roles over the years .like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .or colonel williamsharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny -- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard - hitting roles .which is why his performance in " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is such a shock , such a delight .in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog - loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner 's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .it borders on offensive but does n't really manage it .and it borders on clich ?d stereotype butdoes n't quite succumb to that definition either .in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal -- but he 's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what 's the worst that could happen ?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devitoso how could that be possible ? )moviegoing experience .fichtner 's performance does n't exactly save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommending " what 's the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor 's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film 's rating from no stars to one - and - a - half .thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down -- way , way , down -- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movieso dull and pedestrian and nonsensicalit does n't even warrant discussion .
